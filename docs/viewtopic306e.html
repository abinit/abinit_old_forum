				<h3>Self consistency in gwcalctyp 22</h3>

				<div class="content">I have followed the tutorials, and I have a couple of questions that revolve around the Lebegue contour deformation method and self consistency.  When performing this type of calculation, we introduce the &quot;new&quot; variables nfreqre and nfreqim.  Is it important to do convergence tests with respect to the number of frequencies along both the real and imaginary axes?  The tutorials just give some numbers nfreqre=10 &amp; nfreqim=4 if I recall.  Should these be evenly distributed along their respective axes from 0 to   Secondly, in regards to self consistency, ie gwcalctyp2X, how do what cutoff is used to determine self consistency?  Is it change in the Fermi energy, is it change in the band gap, is it a tolwfr?  The variable info for gwcalctyp &amp; the tutorials simply don't say.  There is a GW variable called gw_nstep  in the gw variable section, but it refers to optdriver=8.  When I check the input variable information for &quot;optdriver&quot; it doesn't go past 5.  <br /><br />Secondly, and this is only related to super cell calculations.   Because of the empty vacuum space increasing the size of the unit cell, the number of bands and G vectors can get quite large.  For a 35Ha cutoff with 8 carbon &amp; 2 fluorine atoms, you get ~15000 Gvectors and 14000 bands if you calculate the full KSS (ie nbandkss -1).  Many other groups don't report an &quot;nband cutoff&quot;.  Is it it sufficient to test the  convergence nband for screening and gw calculations (which I believe must be less than nbandkss)?<br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br />--James</div>
