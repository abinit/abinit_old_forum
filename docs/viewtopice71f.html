But left column says there 50! Why? And why bantot = 400? Please could some one clear it to me, many thanx in any advance!<br /><br />The second issue is acoustic modes. Namely frequencies in Gamma point as a result of calculations. The abinit code  gives the following frequencies:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Phonon frequencies in cm-1&nbsp; &nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />- -1.827276E+01&nbsp; 2.430194E+01&nbsp; 2.430194E+01&nbsp; 1.409284E+02&nbsp; 1.409284E+02</code></pre></div><br />-18cm-1, whatta? It is definitely wrong frequencies. Why it's so high and even negative? Am I lost something? Thank you for reading.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />It is normal that you don't have the same number of kpoints in the ground state and in the DFPT calculation. In the ground state calculation, you have kptopt=1 whereas in the DFPT calculation, kptopt=2. If you want to remove this warning, just put kptopt1=2 and it will be ok. But it's just a warning, so you can leave it be. And since you have 5 times more kpoints in the DFPT calculation, bandtot=400 (5*80).<br /><br />As for the negative phonon frequency, it can stem from the fact that the pseudopotentials that you are using break the acoustic sum rule. To check this, use anaddb (as explained in the tutorial) in order to force the acoustic sum rule. Your phonon frequencies should then be all positive. <br /><br />Boris</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for the reply, Boris! <br />I didn't said that but using anaddb gives right (zero) frequencies of acoustic modes in center, but it also changes a bit (actually not that much but some times up to 20%) optical frequencies. Should I use anaddb data for publications or the ones from the output file?</div>

				<div class="content">Anaddb is supposed to give you the best results. Plus, it is consistent that the three acoustic modes are zero at the gamma point. This is always the case, except when the acoustic sum rule is broken.<br /><br />So I would trust anaddb.<br /><br />Boris</div>
