				<div class="content">For some years I have been working on better optimizers and mixers, mainly for Wien2k. I have a new algorithm (actually one proposed by Bendt and Zunger in 1983) which is mature enough in Wien2k that it is now the recommended optimizer -- it simultaneously &quot;mixes&quot; the density and atomic positions. It is too large to attach, you can find a reprint at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.numis.northwestern.edu/Research/Articles/2013/13_MSR1a.pdf;">http://www.numis.northwestern.edu/Resea ... MSR1a.pdf;</a><!-- m --> it is a bit complicated although the fortran code is not as grim as one might think. Alas JCTC mangled horribly the nomenclature section at the end.<br /><br />I am interested in exploring how this algorithm would work in other codes. Unfortunately I do not have the time (or money) to invest in<br />learning all the internal details of other codes. Perhaps someone would be interested in collaborating to try and implement it in abinit?</div>
