				<div class="content">Dear users,<br />Recently, i used the hybrid functional as implemented in the latest version of abinit. In this post, i want to list some questions really confused me.<br />1) in my understanding, the standar GW calculation can be intepreted as E^{QP}=E^{KS}+Z*&lt;i|{Sigma_x+Sigma_c}|i&gt;-V_{xc},<br />For Sigma_x is the Fock exchange self-energy which can be obtained just do a HF calculation, For Sigma_x is the screen correlation self-energy which can be obtained just do a screen calculation.<br />if i used the hybrid functional, however, only HF calculation is available, and in the ouput, the final QP energy is equal to &lt;hHartree&gt;+&lt;Sigma_x&gt;. Why? what dos the term &lt;hHartree&gt; mean? is there any link between the hybrid funcional+HF and GW calculation?<br />Besides, i know in the hybrid functional, some LDA or GGA exchange-correlation is replaced by Fock exchange. However, it is still very hard for me to find out the link between hybrid function in HF calculation and GW calculaion.<br />Any replies would be appreciated.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sheleon</div>
