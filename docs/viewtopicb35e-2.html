				<h3>Struggling to learn abinit</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Aug 18, 2010 7:42 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>jmullen</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Greetings all,<br /><br />I have been using Quantum Espresso for a few years now and I am atttempting to learn abinit through the tutorials as well as reproducing previous results from QE. So far, I have succeeded in all but one task, which is reproducing the band structure of graphene. I start with a configuration for the rprim, acell , and xangst for the atomic positions. I have calculated multiple datasets for changing acell to find the minimum energy and ionmov=3 for relaxing the atomic positions. The energy minimization curves look good in that I get well-fitted data, but when I try to run the band structure along high symmetry lines, I still get a band gap at K. Of course, I am sure this is due to my mistakes, so I am hoping that someone can point out where I have gone wrong. For brevity, I am attaching one input file which shows the calculation parameters for the band structure which are a result of the convergence studies.<br /><br />Thanks for any help<br />Jeff Mullen<br />North Carolina State University</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Jeff,<br /><br />The coordinates of K point is incorrect, which should be (0.577639, 0.577639, 0) in your system. By the way, an ecut of 120 Ha is too large for carbon; the comment for xangst is incorrect.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your response.<br /><br />I replaced my k points in the input file as you suggested and the final energies calculated are <br /><br />kpt=  0.5776  0.5776  0.0000 (reduced coord)<br /> -14.42183 -13.59451  -8.77891 <strong class="text-strong"> -2.58747   0.75599</strong>   9.20998  10.94101  11.02132<br /><br />I am unsure where to go from here. Either my geometry is wrong, or I am calculating the wrong k point path (using the wrong coordinates).<br /><br />Thanks for your help<br />Jeff Mullen<br />North Carolina State University<br /><br />P.S. Attached are my new input file and the .files (named is changed because I could not upload the &quot;files&quot; extension)</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your help. Between your input file and several hours of experimentation I fixed the multiple problems I had with my geometry and am now reproducing the desired results.<br /><br />Jeff Mullen<br />North Carolina State University</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br /><br />in passing, you shouldn't need 120 Ha unless you are doing all electron carbon (note-pwscf uses Ry)<br /><br />your atomic positions were probably not precise enough (use reduced coordinates 1/3 2/3 0 to make sure you preserve symmetry)<br /><br />The K point, however, was correct as stated &quot;1/3 1/3 0&quot;<br /><br />You could have  problems because the default shift for k-points (0.5 0.5 0.5) has not been removed. You might check this and reset it with &quot;shiftk 0 0 0&quot;<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Matthieu,<br /><br />Thanks for your comments. Since making the original post, I have improved my understanding of the units and how to declare a unit to be in eV instead of Hartree when I need it as well as many other parameters. Once I realized these mistakes, I immediately calculated the correct results.<br /><br />Regards<br />Jeff</div>
