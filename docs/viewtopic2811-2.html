				<div class="content">Has anyone had success with Abinit for molecular systems? I am interested in calculating properties of crystals of small molecules such as 2-methyl-4-nitroaniline (19 atoms, 38 atoms/primitive unit cell). So far, however, I have not been able to get reasonable geometry optimization. The energy and stresses just oscillate and the forces remain above 50 Ha/bohr after 25 Broyd steps, and when I allow the lattice parameter to change, it tries to expand by an order of magnitude. I have tried the default LDA functional with the GTH pseudopotentials and also GGA-PBE with Van der Walls DFT-D2 correction and FHI pseudopotentials.<br /><br />I will continue trying different parameters and functionals, but I was wondering whether anyone had done anything like this before. A similar problem was reported in this thread: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic9817.html?f=8&amp;t=2790">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=2790</a><!-- l -->  so I am starting wonder whether it is even possible with Abinit.<br /><br /><br />Edit: It was just a mistake. My initial atom coordinates were too close for it to optimize the geometry.</div>
