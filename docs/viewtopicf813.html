				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br />I want to buy a video card to accelerate abinit, my problem is (1) Is the capacity of the memory of video card important, is there a great difference between a video card with 1GB memory and that with 2GB memory? Is gtx460 proper for my purpose, or what's your recommendation, around $200? Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">This is not as simple as that, and you may not always get better performances with more memory, since a lot of data has to be transferred from the main memory to the GPU - and vice-versa. These transfers can become a bottleneck under some circumstances, and actually slow down the calculations.<br /><br />There are in any case many criteria to take into account:<br /><ul>  <li>the kind of calculations you want to perform;</li>  <li>the typical size of your systems;</li>  <li>the tunability of your input parameters for this kind of architecture;</li>  <li>whether the GPU is connected to a screen, in which case performances might drop significantly;</li>  <li>the capabilities and limitations of the implementation;</li>  <li>...</li></ul>Buying a GPU only for Abinit might also be a little overkill. You probably should think about using it for other codes as well.</div>
