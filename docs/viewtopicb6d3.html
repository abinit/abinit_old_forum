				<div class="content">Hi everyone, <br /><br />I'm back to development. Currently I'm putting the finishing touches on implementing nuclear magnetic dipoles--they are input with nucdipmom(3,natom) input variable, and then the Hamiltonian is modified to include them (in PAW, both on-site terms and the bare A.p term). Two questions arise:<br /><br />1) Our coding rules forbid use of COMPLEX data types--why? Is this rule still necessary? <br /><br />2) Our coding rules also discourage the use of BLAS, seemingly more for readability than anything else. But the A.p nuclear dipole Hamiltonian in reciprocal space is an npw_k x npw_k matrix at each k point (Hermitian, so storable as one triangle only) and its application to the wavefunction at k is tailor-made for a call to ZHPMV, which with MKL is much faster than any other approach (I've coded about 4 different methods). <br /><br />so--overall, can I use COMPLEX and BLAS in this case? Or, if not, why not?<br /><br />thanks,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Joe,<br />I started to use complex in the following routine:<br />56_xc/dfpt_mkvxc_noncoll.F90<br />which sounds working. However, I didn't make an automatic test yet so I don't know the transferability of it. Should do this automatic test this week...<br />I think we should go toward complex in the future because it will help us in very complex cases (the other complex <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> )...<br />Cheers,<br />Eric</div>
