				<div class="content">Hi there,<br>
New to ABINIT and slightly less new to Homebrew, although I've used it to install other computational codes on my Mac.  I ran into trouble trying to run the python runtests.py program after installing 8.10.3 ABINIT via Homebrew:<br>
<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
  File "../share/tests/runtests.py", line 679, in &lt;module&gt;<br>
    sys.exit(main())<br>
  File "../share/tests/runtests.py", line 379, in main<br>
    build_env = BuildEnvironment(build_dir_path)<br>
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/abinit/8.10.3/share/tests/pymods/testsuite.py", line 988, in __init__<br>
    build_dir = find_top_build_tree(build_dir)<br>
  File "/usr/local/Cellar/abinit/8.10.3/share/tests/pymods/testsuite.py", line 814, in find_top_build_tree<br>
    raise RuntimeError("Cannot find the ABINIT build tree after %s trials" % ntrials)<br>
RuntimeError: Cannot find the ABINIT build tree after 10 trials<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if I need to modify the code somewhere, as it's not pointing to the right place for the ABINIT executable? The Homebrew test log indicated that all of the built-in and fast tests passed, but I'd like to run all the tests just to be sure.<br>
<br>
I tried to work around the problem by uninstalling and then attempting to reinstall ABINIT via Homebrew using the --with-testsuite option, but then I get the following error message:<br>
<br>
Error: An exception occurred within a child process:<br>
  ChecksumMismatchError: SHA256 mismatch<br>
Expected: ede1f6b5ab75c94fe29084443d245f1d934d896d0ac64825ef3a15214f83a7f9<br>
  Actual: 2674119e0aaea6f5e2f4f95aea8c056d9f0d0606d5f0f3a03401a5c435b8d078<br>

To retry an incomplete download, remove the file above.<br>
<br>
Removed the file, tried again, same error message.  I saw a similar problem (for a different reason) in a much older post, and it seemed the underlying problem was in homebrew-science.  I guess I would have expected that that was solved by 8.10.3, so I'm wondering what I might be doing wrong.<br>
<br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br>
Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Outerplanets,<br>
<br>
To analyse the problem, we need more information :<br>
- how did you install abinit via homebrew (using homebrew-science or the new formula provided on abinit github?)<br>
- what did you exactly type to lauch the runtests.py script?, from which directory?<br>
- did you use "brew clean abinit"?</div>

				<div class="content">OK,<br>
I was able to reproduce the issue.<br>
<br>
A new version of the homebrew formula is now available.<br>
If you use the bottle, a wrapper to the runtests script will be installed.<br>
If you recompile from scratch, you have to use the -with-testsuite option.<br>
<br>
You'll be able to run the test suite with the 'ABINIT-runtests' scripts.<br>
Just type 'abinit-runtests --help' to learn more.<br>
<br>
Note that some libXC tests will fail because the references files have been generated with libXC v3.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps...</div>
