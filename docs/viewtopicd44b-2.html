				<h3>mpi issues</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I have a problem with my mpi paramaters, in the crystal system I'm calculating, there are 167 bands, and when I run on a cluster, a message as follows constantly comes up:<br /><br />&quot;You should try to get npband*bandpp=167<br /> For information matrix size is   177655&quot;<br /><br />For each step this message comes up several times before actually doing any calculation and as a result mpi is much slower than non-mpi runs. The problem is, I can't come up with a combination of npband and bandpp that gives 167, it's just impossible. <br /><br />Has anyone else ever encountered such an issue? How did you deal with it?<br /><br />Any comments would be most appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear baisxun,<br />You can increase nband to &gt;167 that can fit with the number of k-points, etc and the number of CPU. Sometimes having a bit more bands but optimizing the scalability drives you to a much faster calculation.<br />Did you specify the parameters of paral_kgb yourself (npband, npkpt, npfft, bandpp) or did you use the automatic flag?<br />If you initialize paral_kgb=1 by hand can you send the values you put?<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>

The parallel parameters I used are as follows:<br /><br />paral_kgb 1<br />npband 4<br /> npfft 2<br />npkpt 4<br />bandpp 1<br /><br />If I understand the parameter settings correctly, it multplies to 32, which is bigger than 20, but it somehow still runs. <br /><br />So I should assign, for example, 180 processors, which is bigger than 167, and come up with a combination of npband*npfft*npkpt that gives 180, correct?<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Shixun</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Shixun,<br />Lets first suppose we parallelize only on bands and kpoints (i.e. npfft=1).<br />The best is first to have npkpt=nkpt because the parallelism over k-point is the most efficient (it requires low communication between MPI processes).<br />Then for the bands the deal is to have nband/npband = integer. In your case nband=167 is a really bad number because it cannot be divided by anything but 167... nband=168 is much better because it can be divided by 2, 4, 6, 8 and 21, which can thus be used as values for npband.<br />Parallelizing beyond npband=16 bands will start to give a less good speedup (this should be tested on your system and machine to see up to which npband value you still have a speedup) and so in your case good values for npband are 2, 4, 6 or 8 if you set nband=168.<br /><br />The number of CPU of your job should always be equal to npkpt*npband*npfft.<br /><br />If you have to go further with more CPU numbers, you can start to switch on the parallelism over fft-grid points by having npfft&gt;1.<br /><br />Another possibility is to use the OpenMP parallelism through bandpp flag (if you have compiled Abinit with OpenMP flag) if you want to use threading, let me know if you want to use it on the top of MPI.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>

That helped a lot! I am so new at this at I didn't even know nband is something you can manually redefine, how embarrassing...<br /><br />According to our cluster manager, he did compile ABINIT with OpenMP. So is that why I get the message &quot;you should set the number of threads to something close to 1&quot; ? In the trial runs I either set bandpp = 1 or don't specify anything for bandpp, so intuitively I shouldn't get that message, I suppose?<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />Shixun</div>
