				<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br /><br />I am currently running a single k-point calculation using abinit to compare the result with my own code. Since I want to compare the number of bases used in the abinit and my approach, and my calculation is only a single k-point calculation, I take mpw number in the ouput file as the number of basis functions being used in abinit. However, then I found in the ouput file, there are two npw, one is consistent with mpw, the other is npw (full set), which is two times larger than npw.<br /><br /> wfconv:   160 bands initialized randomly with npw=623757, for ikpt=     1<br />_setup2: Arith. and geom. avg. npw (full set) are 1247513.000 1247513.000<br /><br />I think this is in the same case as in this page <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://estest.ucdavis.edu/exist/estest/www/xql/stdout.xql?uuid=0c2558cf-8a49-45bc-937f-6b4c20a3dfed&amp;fname=Benzene.out">http://estest.ucdavis.edu/exist/estest/ ... enzene.out</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Could anyone kindly help me with the questions<br />a. why would the latter npw (full set) is 2 times greater than mpw?<br />b. which one should I refer to as the reference number of basis functions used in abinit?<br /><br />Thanks a lot in advance for you guys kind help.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Did you parallelise this calculation? If I multiply the smallest npw with the number of cores I use, I got roughly the value of npw (full set). Did you parallelise this calculation over 2 cores?<br /><br />In that case I think you'd need to take into account the full set value.<br /><br />with kind regards,<br /><br />Annelinde</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your reply, I did parallelize the code, but I am definitely sure I was parallelizing the code over much more than 2 processors. And I checked the code which computing mpw and npw locating at<br /><br />ABINIT_DIR/src/56_recipspace/getmpw.F90<br />ABINIT_DIR/src/52_fft_mpi_noabirule/m_fftcore.F90<br /><br />The formulae used to compute the npw/mpw seems to be (2*ecut)**(3/2) * ucvol / (6*pi**2), which is identical to the 1247513 result. But In the .out file, mpw and npw are shown to be 623757, which is just half. I'm not sure if I misunderstood anything or there is a bug in calculating npw/mpw when doing gamma point calculation.<br /><br />I appreciate a lot if anyone could help me with this.</div>
