				<div class="content">Dear memebers of this community: Although I am newbie  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" />  in using ABINIT I though I understood the basic features of it until I confront myself to the example of positron calculations (/abinitx.x.x/tests/v4/Input/t95.in and /abinitx.x.x/tests/v4/Input/t96.in ). I found that for running that test (seeing the /abinitx.x.x/tests/v4/Refs/t95.out and  /abinitx.x.x/tests/v4/Refs/t96.out ), the computation of course needed a pseudopotencial file for the atoms used (in these case Aluminium) and the one used this time was 13al.psppos file. Reading also the stuff from internet I found that the pseudopotencial files used for positron calculations must be the FHI (Fritz-Haber-Institute) pseudopotentials <br />and indeed the file from 13-Al.LDA.fhi (the one that it is open if you click on Aluminium on the web page of FHI pseudopotencials, <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/lda_fhi">http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-lin ... ks/lda_fhi</a><!-- m -->) is very similar to 13al.psppos  one. Similar but not equal! in fact, the files looks exactly the same but 13al.psppos has a block at the end that 13-Al.LDA-fhi does not!! Trying myself to make positron calculus for other elements I notice that I could not do it properly with the pseudopotencial files .fhi; meaning that this difference between 13-Al.LDA.fhi and 13al.psppos file is important to make this calculus right. The problem then resides on that: How to &quot;convert&quot; from .fhi file to a one .psppos???<br /> Any ideas???</div>

				<div class="content">I see that the post now has already a couple of views but no answers. I beg anyone that visits me leave me a comment, independently that they know how to solve this problem I am mentioned. I am interested if my post is clear or if you visiters have any question to me.<br /> Regards,<br />               Sergio</div>

I don't know the details of the positron pseudopotential. You should check the literature, and see if the contributors from CEA have a reference or 2. Read CPC 180 1582 Gonze et al. in particular, which should have further in depth references. Also check if this has been announced as a production feature (in the release notes for 5.9 and 6.0) to make sure that it _should_ be working properly in the general case.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
