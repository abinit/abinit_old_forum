				<div class="content">While running abinit, I'm consistently getting jobs which exit early on larger jobs (either during the first iteration or beforehand) just after the following message.<br /><br />&quot;-P-0000  leave_test : synchronization done...<br />-P-0000  leave_test : exiting...&quot;<br /><br />This happened when I went from a 2x2 unit cell of graphene to a 3x3 unit cell of graphene, and when I increased the vacuum spacing on a silver slab to a large unit cell.  I would have thought it was due to a memory usage issue, but it doesn't go away if I increase the number of nodes &amp; processors (&amp; thus the available memory). Am I doing something dumb?  I've attached  the input, output, and log files for the graphene unit cell where this happens (labelled as graphod.* for my own personal naming reasons).  I've queued this job on 2 nodes with 20GB on each node.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm so sorry this is clearly in the wrong forum.  I meant to place this in the Input file or Platform specific forum.  I'm running these jobs on carver.nersc.gov, one of the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab computers using abinit 6.0.3</div>

				<div class="content">Hello JEJohns,<br /><br />in the latest versions (6.2 I think, and certainly upcoming 6.4) I have made this error message more verbose: it arises because some of your processors are not responding. This can be due to:<br /><br />1) some of them didn't manage to allocate memory. Check the individual *LOG* files for each one. This is the most common reason.<br />2) you have chosen a proc distribution which is not consistent (e.g. more than you have k-points) in which case some processors end up empty and complain.<br />3) other, real, error on the nodes. If possible check which nodes are complaining.<br /><br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, I've switched positions and am now working @ Northwestern &amp; argon, but I hear that they upgraded carver.nersc.gov to 6.2.1, so I'll pass the info along. Thanks<br />James</div>
