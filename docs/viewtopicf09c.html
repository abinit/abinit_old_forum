				<div class="content">For some builds and/or machines, problems may occur in energy.F90 when ph1d is copied to gs_hamk%ph1d via<br />gs_hamk%ph1d(:,:)  = ph1d(:,:)<br /><br />Namely, the array ph1d is not defined for all indices (it is set in getphd called by scfcv), because its dimentions are determined by the largest of numbers ngfft(1),ngfft(2),ngff(3) while the &quot;real&quot; array is defined only up to a boundary determined by the actual values of the ngfft(1),ngfft(2),ngff(3) numbers.<br /><br />As a result, when copying ph1d(:,:) to gs_hamk%ph1d(:,:) in  energy.F90 , the code will touch also &quot;undefined&quot; values which have been initiated randomly and this may cause &quot;floating point&quot; errors, which are de facto irrelevant but which still make the code to crash.<br /><br />A quick fix I am using is to defined the array ph1d in the scfcv.F90 subroutine for all indices in the beginning of this subroutine:<br /> ph1d(:,:) = 1.0_dp   ! Otherwise issues in energy due to undefined values <br /><br />A more &quot;grown-up&quot; way of dealing with this might be either amending the dimension of the ph1d array or restricting the indices for which ph1d is copied to gs_hamk%ph1d in energy.F90.  However, that would be too advanced for my degree of familiarity with the package.<br /><br />I encountered this issue with the 6.12.1 version.<br />I understand that this error does not occur always and everywhere but when it occurs, it hurts...<br /><br />Ondrej</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Ondrej,<br /><br />Thanks for the bug report;<br />after several months, I have included a modification in Abinit (to be published in Abinit v7).<br />I have initialized ph1d directly in the getph subroutine (dedicated to ph1d computation).<br /><br />Marc Torrent</div>
