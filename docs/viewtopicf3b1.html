				<h3>Optimization of large systems</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello:<br /><br />I am trying to optimize the geometry of a crystal with 118 atoms in the unit cell with ionmov = 2. Unfortunately, this is exceedingly slow using the number of planewaves and k-points that seems necessary to get converged results, as described in the tutorials.<br /><br />My question is, is it worthwhile (in terms of time and accuracy) to optimize the geometry with less planewaves or k-points first and then do a second optimization with the larger basis set using the geometry from the more coarse calculation?<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Kale</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Kale<br /><br />It depends on your system. I guess that would work for a calculation with standard DFT. You can start from a less converged calculation and increase the accuracy little by little. I would not expect this to work with a DFT+U calculation for instance, because the low converged calculation would get you in some metastable state in which your system will be stuck, even with higher convergence criteria.<br /><br />For a large supercell, the best way would be to try and optimize npkpt, npband and bandpp. I guess you have very few kpoints and a lot of bands. Try npkpt = nkpt * nsppol, then adjust npband. If you increase bandpp, your scf steps will be slower but your convergence will be greatly improve, so in the end you get the same running time.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />Boris</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with Boris--kgb parallelization does work well for ground state calculations, including geometry optimization. My strategy is to take advantage of the paral_kbg -nproc feature, and see what abinit recommends for npkpt and so forth. You can then also tweak the k point grid (using prtkpt 1 to get different possibilities consistent with your system) and also nband, to force say a few extra empty bands so that the number of bands and k points both share a lot of common factors with the number of processors you can use, for best efficiency.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Abinit Folks,<br /><br />I too am trying to optimize the geometry of a crystal, however for a system with 109 atoms : a 3x3x3 fcc Al cluster with a self interstitial. I am doing this study for the system subjected to volumetric strain from 0% to 25% Tensile. The combination of ionmov=1, amu=28, dtion=400,vis=100 works robustly for low level of strain (0 - 12%). HOwever, beyond this level, I am unable to reduce the max force below 1e-3. I have tried out all the available ionmov schemes (BFGS, DIIS, Quenched MD, damped MD) but to no avail. I would be greatly obliged if you could provide me with some insight/ share your experience in relaxing such systems. I am also attaching my input file (if it is of any help) <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mrinal</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Folks,<br /><br />I take back what I said. It turns out that the issues I was observing was because of not performing a k-point convergence study each time I increased the cell size. The errors in the force evaluation became too high (~1e-3) for any relaxation to occur. <br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mrinal</div>
