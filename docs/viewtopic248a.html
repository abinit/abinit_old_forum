				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I am using the DMFT implementation of ABINIT to solve the AIM with CT-HYB. I am interested in the total energy of my system and I am happy that ABINIT can calculate it for DMFT.<br /><br />However, I obtain a difference in the occupation between the impurity Greens function and the local Greens function that I have no explanation for. I want to solve the impurity model just once so that i only run the DMFT loop once. Therefore the mixing of the self-energy was set to 1. For further details see the attached input file. I set nstep to 200, but this was a mistake. I canceld the calculation after the first step, so don't wonder why the log-file is not complete (I don't want charge self consistency for now).<br /><br />After the CT-QMC I obtain a local occupation of 7.81 (G(tau) in line 3932 of the log file).<br /><br />After the mixing of the self-energy and post-treatment the occupation of G(_loc??) is 7.40. The occupation of 7.40 could also be obtained after the search of the new Fermi level.<br /><br />If that was G_loc in this case (line 4076 and 4157 of the log file) shouldn't it be the same value as G_imp?<br /><br />At least if I set U = 0 it is the case (unfortunately I lost the results, but if required I can reproduce them).<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Philipp</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Philipp,<br /><br />The number of electrons obtained after the Monte Carlo (line 3932) is the trace of the impurity Green's function G_imp.<br />The number of electrons written on line 4076 and 4157 is the trace of the local Green's function G_loc.<br /><br />These two Green's functions are in general different.<br /><br />However, at convergence of the DMFT loop, G_loc=G_imp.<br />But in your calculation, you did not converge the DMFT loop because you did only one iteration of the DMFT loop.<br />Try dmft_iter=10 and the two numbers should be closer....<br /><br />Of course, if U=0, G_imp=G_loc=G_locLDA is constant.<br /><br />Best regards<br />Bernard</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Mr. Amadon,<br /><br /><br />I totally agree with you. For a lattice problem like SrVO3 the convergence is, of course, required to have G_imp = G_loc. I tested this with SrVO3 and it works fine. But for a non-lattice problem, like in my case (a single Co atom on a cupper surface), I would assume that the convergence is not required, because this is an example for a single impurity coupled to an electronic bath (i.e. an Anderson Impurity Model).<br /><br /><br />However, more important for me is the calculation of the total energy. Do you think that even with one iteration the energy is meaningful? How would you handle a single adatom on a metallic surface with ABINIT, if you are interested in the total energy?<br /><br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br /><br />Philipp</div>
