				<h3>Creating an amorphous HfO2 supercell on ABINIT</h3>

				<div class="content">Please I would like to have some hints about how to create an amorphous HfO2 supercell. BTW I am beginner to ABINIT. <br />I think I will approach the problem through the following steps:<br />First, create a unit cell of HfO2.<br />Then, preform ground energy calculations (make convergence on both the acell and ecut values in order to achieve the minimum total energy)<br />After that, make a super cell of the unit cell by repeating it in x , y , and z? I do not have any knowledge about how this is done! <br />Then, go preform ground energy calculations again to achieve minimum ground state energy of this super cell<br /><br />About amorphous I can not understand what does it mean. BTW I think by having a super cell of HfO2 then its then amorphous (Not sure but thinking).<br /><br />Please kindly help with any hint or information.<br /><br /><br />Actually I know that HfO2 has three phases which are: a) cubic, b) tetragonal, c) monoclinic.<br /><br />The cubic HfO2 structure is something like that the attached image.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Hassan</div>

				<div class="content">I think if I am going to work on the cubic phase of the HfO2 then the unit cell will consist of three atoms which are Hf of atomic number 72, and the other 2 are oxygen atoms of atomic number 8. Also the atomic position will be defined by the xred variable in ABINIT something like that:<br />xred<br />   0.0  0.0  0.0 <br />   1/4  1/4  1/4  <br />   3/4  3/4  3/4  <br /><br />Please correct me if I am going the wrong path.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Hassan</div>

				<div class="content">I think first I should do convergence on both the values of ecut and acell<br /><br />I did convergence on ecut (attached the convergence curve)<br /><br />The converged ecut value is 80 Ha <br /><br />BTW I found that the converged total energy value is -82.36 Ha ! (Actually this quite a big value)<br /><br />Please if anybody could help am I doing the correct steps or not?<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Thanks,<br />Hassan</div>

				<div class="content">I think I managed to create the unit cell of cubic HfO2 (attached the band structure). Actually I am not quite sure this is the correct band structure as it gives bandgap value (3.8eV) much greater than the theoretical value 3.6eV. How could I fix this band structure?<br /><br />Also, please any hint about how to create a super cell of the amorphous HfO2. <br />As I knew that amorphous HfO2 mean super cell of HfO2 (i.e. breaking the periodicity of the crystal structure). <br />Is that correct?<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Thanks,<br />Hassan.</div>
