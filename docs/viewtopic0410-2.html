The files from the tutorial directory are the first ones a newbie uses and builds hers/his calculations upon. The Tutorial itself directs users to them.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>For your error, something else is going on...

The files are in the attachment. tnlo_5.files contains the 4th dummy line I added. After adding, anaddb runs without problem. The one I took from the abinit-5.8.4/tests/tutorespfn/Input directory doesn't contain this additional line (the last one).<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>Not at all - your comment was quite correct in that the correspondence between input acell and acell inside the program is not transparent: for the input conventional units are more convenient, and inside the lattice vector lengths are always used.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there are often compensating factors, such as  1./sqrt(2) (=0.7) or 1/sqrt(3) (=0.57), and the bohr radius (=0.53), which are more or less similar, so you end up getting numbers which are close for a_cubic in Angstrom and acell_primitive in bohr - terrible!

But Your comparison sentence is quite good and gives a nice example. Maybe it should also find its place inside the Tutorial (at least I don't remember seeing it). It is like the fact that you repeat throughout the Tutorial that the convergence testing should be done on the property wanted, and not just ex. energy. After one finishes the Tutorial, this fact remains on mind.<br />My opinion is that when one tries to explain smth to someone, repeating is one of the key issues. If you repeat smth (what you think might be confusing or controversial (too strong word) in the future) from the beginning, then after enough time it will get into the ones ear and she/he will remember it, i.e. have it in mind. This can be tedious, for it usually concerns the basics, but the issue is what you want do achieve with the tutorial. Remembering is the start for understanding.<br />But You were absolutely right, anyone with even starting knowledge on crystals understands the difference between the input and inside acell.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Igor Lukacevic</div>
