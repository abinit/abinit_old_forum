				<div class="content">Hi everybody...<br />I'm trying to determine lattice constant (a) for BN by calculating the total energy for different values of a using ABINIT, then chose the one which  correspond the minimum value of energy, Is this convenient way to determine a ??<br />the second question, Is Murnaghan equation implemented in the Abinit??<br /><br />Thanks...<br />with regards...</div>

				<div class="content">Well, you can determine the lattice constants the way you say, but I think it is much easier and more robust to use the ionmov and optcell inputs. Is there a reason why you are doing it directly without making use of ionmov and optcell?<br /><br />Secondly, the Murnahan eqn is not coded in abinit, what you would do is extract the total energies and unit cell volumes from a series of runs and paste them into a graphing program or script of your own to do the equation fit.</div>
