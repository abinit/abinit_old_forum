				<div class="content">Dear all,<br />       It's me again,:)<br />       i just have finished the static non-linear suscepblity calculation for KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF), whose space group is 155(R32),every thing goes well (ecut,kpoints testing , structure optimaztion,response calculation),after running anaddb,i obtained the non-linear suscepbility. The results i got is d21=-d22=-d15 are non-zero term which should belong to the point group R3m, and the R32 point group which <br />i calculate shoud have only non-zero term d11.<br />       i aslo check the log file, according to the parameter acell and rprim the code really determine the space group 155 which is also point group R32.<br />       i am really confused that.<br />       could be some problem in my calculation? <br />       Thanks in advance.<br /><br />       Xiaole</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Xiaole, <br /><br />Could you gives us the value you are talking about? If the values are small it could be due to numerical accuracy problems. Did you impose a sum rules in your calculation?</div>
