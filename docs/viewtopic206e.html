				<h3>Magnetisation and magnetization (some doubts about )</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi, following the spin tutotorial (part 1, bcc Fe), I get confused of some points and I wonder if anyone can help clear my mind about this:<br /><br />1) &quot;Spinat&quot; input variable<br />It is declared as &quot;Gives the initial electronic spin-magnetisation for each atom, in unit of h-bar/2.&quot; wich seems confusing to me. Magnetic moments of atoms are expressed in Ampere (times) metre square (Joule/Tesla in SI or emu in CGS) wich in the case of Iron it is known as 2,2 bohr magnetons. It is indicated in the input file of Fe as &quot;spinat 0. 0. 4.&quot; wich seems to be the sum of the value of spins (has the units of spin eigenvalues) of the 2 s electrons of iron (I do not  understand as &quot;the spin-magnetization). Is that like I said?<br /><br />2) Outputs Magnetization and Magnetisation:<br />What is generally reported in scientific literature as &quot;Magnetization&quot; with letter M (independently of if is saturation or remanent or other) is the magnetic moment per volumen (also know as magnetization per volume). Wich is units of Ampere/metre (or emu/cm^-3).  Also in literature is reported the magnetization per unit mass (indicated with greek letter sigma) wich has units of Ampere x  metre square / kilograma (or in CGS as emu/g). In &quot;Introduction to Magnetic Materials&quot; of Cullity-Graham book, it is reported at 0 K that iron has sigma_0 = 221,9 emu/g. While if you look at the ouput of running tutotorial spin 1 (/abinit6.x.x/test/tutorial/tspin_1.in) there two &quot;magnetizations&quot;:<br />2.A First it is reported the Magnetization as &quot;(spin up - spin down) [el/Bohr^3]&quot; with its minimums and maximums. <br />I do not understand the usefullness of this reported values, even more I do not understand why the spins are not all &quot;paralel&quot; at 0 K.<br />2.B There is a second report as Magnetisation (with s instead of z), wich is reported in &quot; Magnetisation (Bohr magneton)=  1.96743487E+00&quot;. Wich seems to be the magnetic moment per atom (sometimes reported as (greek letter mu)_H and should be 2,219 (page 531 of Cullity-Graham) instead of 1,967 Bohr magnetons. Here if this value is what I guess I do not understand why is not called like it should (meaning &quot;Magnetic moment per atom&quot;), and why the non-deprecible difference with reported values cited. Even more, during that ABINIT can compute volumen and density, I do not understand why ABINIT does not report Magnetization per volumen or per mass.<br /> If anyone can solve my doubts I would be very gratefull.</div>
