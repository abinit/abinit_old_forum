				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />When calculating a KSS file I periodically get this warning every few k-points:<br /><br /> outkss.F90:1403:WARNING<br />  The diagonalized eigenvalues differ by more than 10^-3 Hartree<br /> with respect to the conjugated gradient values.<br /><br />My questions: (1) If its calculating both the Conjugated Gradient values and Diagonalized values and then comparing, can I just get it to write out two KSS files instead of one, for each method? (that way I can <em class="text-italics">really</em> see what the difference between the two is). (2) How should I alleviate this difference? Should I use tighter convergence parameters? On wavefunctions? Energy?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mamikon</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I think this message is not really robust. You should not carry too much attention to it.<br />Just make sure that your eigenvalues/wavefunctions are well converged within the CG technique.<br />Sorry for this sloppy reply.<br /><br />Fabien</div>

				<div class="content">The diagonalization step performed during the KSS generation can be seen as an additional SCF iteration. <br />The diagonalized eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are therefore close to the ones calculated during the <br />SCF (NSCF) run provided that the SCF (NSCF) cycle is very well converged.<br /><br />You don't have your input file but I guess that only the high energy states produced <br />by the direct diagonalization differ from the conjugate gradient ones.<br />To get rid of the annoying message you might do the following:<br /><br />* Use a stricter criterion for tolwfr (&lt; 10^-16)<br />* Increase the number of bands (nband) as well as the value of nbdbuf such that <br />  (nband - nbdbuf) spans the energy range you are planning to use for GW.<br /><br />The highest states are indeed difficult to converge when iterative techniques (e.g CG) are used.<br />and the nbdbuf trick partly cures the problem.<br /><br />Note that tolwfr is the recommended stopping criterion to be used to generate the  KSS file,<br />even when the KSS is produced at the end of a SCF run.<br />Neither toldfe nor tolvrs are good estimators for the accuracy of the band structure <br />as they only probe the converge of the occupied states. Besides the energy functional<br />is variational with respect to density variations...<br /><br />Hope it helps<br />Matteo Giantomassi</div>

				<div class="content">Matteo, Fabien,<br /><br />Thanks for your replies. I did feel that the warnings were not very dangerous, but wanted to take care of them anyway. I'll try out your suggestions next time I calculate a KSS file and post the results.<br /><br />-Mamikon Gulian</div>

				<div class="content">Just an update: I increased the convergence parameters and that made the warnings vanish, but as it turned out, this caused no difference in results- that is, the previous settings were already well converged despite the warnings. I guess the warnings were not essential.</div>
