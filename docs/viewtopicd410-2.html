				<div class="content">Dear Sir,<br />I am a new user of ABINIT. I have installed the latest version of ABINIT (abinit-6.0.4) on my PC having linux version<br /><br /><br />I have read the tutorial, when I run programmes of lesson1 and 2 it run quite easily.<br /><br /><br />when I tried to run for lesson3 (taking all the files mentioned in lesson3). It runs but taking long time means it runs for more than 2 days but not completed.<br /><br />similar observation for lesson 4.<br /><br />Please advice.<br /><br /><br />DR. Ashish Pathak</div>

You can find typical<br />corresponding output files in tests/tutorial/Refs , you will see that<br />you need between seconds and two minutes at most.<br /><br />There must be a problem of installation/compilation/library/...<br /><br />X.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />First, I guess ou already know that the error you encounter is most likely coming from the compiling tools you use. I also guess that you have tried various level of optimization of the binary code to try to circumvent your problem ? <br /><br />Here follows a possible way to get out of your problem :<br />Do you have any experience in running a debugger ? If you have, it could be a nice tool to try solving this mystery.  If I understand correctly Abinit is running an infinite loop while trying to pass test number 3 ? To check what is happening I would proceed the following way :<br />- compile Abinit with debugging symbols (option -g on the compilation line). <br />- run again the fast tests. If the same error doesn't happen any more, it would mean that the errors produced by your compiler are very sensitive to optimization and that you may better try again optimization tweaking. Otherwise proceed to the following.<br />- Run only the test that fails in the debugger (doing something like <br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>gdb PATH_TO_ABINIT/abinit<br />run &lt; input_file_for_test_that_fails<br /></code></pre></div><br />Once you've waited enough, interrupt the run by sending an interruption signal (usually using ctrl+c). Then input &quot;bt&quot; to the debugger. It should print you exactly where the code was at the moment you interrupted it. From this point you can start debugging; or at least, knowing which file fails try to compile this file only with specific option.<br /><br />Hope, I'm not missing something I should have read previously...<br />regards<br /><br />PMA</div>
