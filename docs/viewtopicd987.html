				<div class="content">Hi to all,<br /><br />I was compiling and running  ABINIT with different compiler and on <br />many platforms and everything worked fine.<br />Now I tried to compile ABINIT on my laptop with both IFORT AND GFORTRAN but<br />I found that when I increase the size of the system (in recursion method it corresponds to the size of the ngfft grid)<br />the IFORT compiled version gives a segmentation fault where GFORTRAN gives the good result <br />(but GFORTRAN is much more slow: I compiled with the &quot;aggressive&quot; compilation option for which IFORT is very fast).<br /><br />As it was impossible for me to detect where was the error (gdb, compilation options) so I goggled a little bit<br />and I found that this error is explained by the behavior of these two compilers with respect to allocating automatic arrays.<br />IFORT allocates automatic arrays on the stack by default while GFORTRAN allocates them on the heap. <br /><br />As in my subroutines I have a lots of automatic arrays I tried to increase my stack memory by &quot;ulimit&quot; and I compiled <br />IFORT with the extra-flags:<br />FCFLAGS_EXTRA=&quot;-heap-arrays 1024&quot;<br />CFLAGS_EXTRA=&quot;-heap-arrays 1024&quot;<br /><br />Finally the IFORT compiled version works fine.<br /><br />Now I ask me if I have to replace automatic arrays (more faster) with allocatable array.<br />Do you have a better idea to resolve this problem?<br /><br />bye <br />Marco</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if there is a better solution. It depends essentially on your priorities (speed, reliability, portability, ...).<br /><br />Please note that the concepts of heap and stack are architecture-dependent. Some computers may even not have one of the two.<br /><br />If speed is critical, it is usually better to use the stack. If not, allocatable arrays will likely have a more reliable and portable behavior.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for you reply Yann,<br />As recursion is thought to run on big machine or workstation <br />(where I suppose a bigger stack memory than in my laptop), <br /> as you implicitly suggest, I will not touch my arrays.<br />thanks a lot <br />Marco</div>
