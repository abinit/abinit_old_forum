				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />my public branch fails one test, tv6_43, on <span class="posthilit">the</span> build farm with <span class="posthilit">the</span> failure information<br /><br /> Case_43<br /><span class="posthilit">The</span> diff analysis cannot be pursued : <span class="posthilit">the</span> <span class="posthilit">command</span> <span class="posthilit">sign</span> <span class="posthilit">differ</span>.<br />File 1, line 895, 89 ignored, character: <br />File 2, line 895, 89 ignored, character:=<br /><br />Summary Case_43 : fatal error, see above message<br /><br />This test runs fine on my machine. On my machine line 895 of <span class="posthilit">the</span> output file is a string of &quot;=&quot; signs beginning in <span class="posthilit">the</span> left most column, I assume this is <span class="posthilit">the</span> problem? But I'm not at all sure what I should do about it (my code additions didn't add any output writing). Any help you can suggest would be much appreciated.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Joe,<br /><br />From <span class="posthilit">the</span> information provided on <span class="posthilit">the</span> buildbot Web pages, you could not identify what was <span class="posthilit">the</span> problem.<br />You should have had access to <span class="posthilit">the</span> full t43.diff file to see what was going wrong. It is planned<br />to give full access to these *.diff files in <span class="posthilit">the</span> future (and no more <span class="posthilit">the</span> 50 last lines).<br /><br />Now, back to your problem : I did access <span class="posthilit">the</span> testf machine, to see what was wrong.<br />It is only a very small problem of portability. Actually, using nstep=10 should fix it.<br />If you agree, I can fix it and proceed with <span class="posthilit">the</span> usual week-end merge with your branch included ...<br />Indeed, this is <span class="posthilit">the</span> only problem of your branch.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Xavier</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />thanks for <span class="posthilit">the</span> tip. Are <span class="posthilit">the</span> test files always supposed to have an nstep=10 limit? I can add that and push again.</div>
