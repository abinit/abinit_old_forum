				<h3>k-point generation in ABINIT</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Oct 21, 2009 9:04 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>mverstra</strong></div>
				<div class="content">There are 2 standard ways to specify the kpoint grid, either with<br /><strong class="text-strong">kptrlatt</strong> or with <strong class="text-strong">ngkpt</strong> (see <a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/input-variables" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/input-variables</a>).<br />These make a single uniform grid, centered on<br />gamma, and which is either aligned with the reciprocal space lattice<br />vectors (<strong class="text-strong">ngkpt</strong>) or more general (<strong class="text-strong">kptrlatt</strong>).<br /><br /><br />Then you add on the shifts, taking the uniform grid and replicating it<br />once for each shift (so if there is no 0 0 0 shift, then gamma is not<br />contained in the final set).<br /><br />Then the grid is reduced to a general <strong class="text-strong">kptrlatt</strong> lattice, plus some shifts.<br /><br />In <em class="text-italics">all</em> of the normal cases, and all the Monkhorst Pack grids, and<br />almost all you ever want to do, it is possible to reduce to a<br />single-shifted <strong class="text-strong">kptrlatt</strong>. Often the <strong class="text-strong">kptrlatt</strong> will not be &quot;orthogonal&quot;,<br />ie not oriented along the reciprocal lattice vectors, but this is not<br />a problem. In many other codes it is not possible to generate a<br />&quot;non-orthogonal&quot; grid, even though the MP<br />specification explicitly creates these grids, in order to get a<br />uniform density of kpts in cartesian reciprocal space (as opposed to<br />reduced reciprocal space).<br /><br />However, you have full freedom to choose kpoints as you wish (you can<br />also specify them explicitly with <strong class="text-strong">nkpt</strong> <strong class="text-strong">wkpt</strong> and <strong class="text-strong">kpt</strong>). If you set:<br /><br />ngkpt 6 6 4<br />nshiftk 2<br /><span class="posthilit">shiftk</span><br />0.5 0.5 0.5<br />0.33 0.33 0.15<br /><br />then abinit will not be able to reduce the grid (I just tried, to make<br />sure), and it is a clear indicator that the grid is not homogeneous in<br />space. You may have some good reason to do this, but of course the GW<br />calculations (and others, electron-phonon, etc) do not like this<br />because they count on being able to use symmetry operations to<br />complete perturbations and wave functions. If your k grid breaks the<br />symmetry of the full crystal, this is not possible. This is shown in the following<br />figures. The unshifted hexagonal 2x2 grid<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

But even with a<br />single shift you are still not guaranteed to respect the symmetries:<br />you have to choose it appropriately (0.5 0.5 0.5 for cubic, 0 0 0.5<br />for tetragonal and hexagonal...)</div>

The best would be a uniform grid (coarse), and near K splitting it into a finer grid (say 2 times finer) with weights divided by 2x2=4 (for 2 dimensions in the plane), such that the weight per unit area stays constant.<br />Usually people just hit graphene with all the k-points they can muster<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />2) Is it possible to generate a kpt list that contains a specific kpt?

				<div class="content">Hello<br />I am using a visual software that generate the input files for abinit (nothing to do with the parameters, everything set visually), but every time I am running it, the simulation failed.

				<div class="content">Hi jtalia,<br /><br />I assume you look for a reasonable value for the difference in energy between SCF cycles to stop. There is no recipe here, you should be able to find it by performing a convergence study. Just a guess ... I would say 10^-8 maybe even smaller but look on your actual model at the evolution of the energy.<br />Curiosity will kill me ... can you disclose the name of that magic visual software that produces Abinit files?<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>
