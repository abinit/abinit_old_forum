				<div class="content">Hi, <br /><br />I am very confused by the Abinit literature.<br /><br />It says for vdw-xc:   7: apply vdw-DFT-D3(BJ) as proposed by Grimme (based on Becke-Jonhson method J. Chem. Phys. 2004-2006) <br /> Available only for ground-state calculations and response functions; <span style="text-decoration: underline">see vdw_tol variable to control convergency </span><br /><br />I go to vdw_tol.<br />there it says:<br />Only relevant if vdw_xc==5  <br /><br />Ok. Great.<br />So I do a bunch of relaxations and I notice while using vdw == 7 the following: --------------------------------------------------------------<br />    Van der Waals DFT-D3 semi-empirical dispersion potential<br />    with Becke-Jonhson (BJ) refined by Grimme et al. J.<br />    Comput.

				<div class="content">Dear JB, <br />DFT-D1, DFT-D2 and DFT-D3 stands for different versions of the so called Grimme method to include van der Waals eenrgies in DFT. In DFT-D3 a three-body term can be included (however, this is not reason why it is called DFT-D3). In the literature, people have used the denomination DFT-D3 both when they were including, or not this three-body term. Its use is generally given in the computational method. On the other hand the difference between DFT-D3  and the DFT-D3(BJ) method relies in the type of damping function used for two-body contributions to the vdW energy for small interatomic distances. With this in mind vdw_xc=7 corresponds to the DFT-D3(BJ) method. <br /><br />Concerning the tolerance (vdw_tol), it is in fact used in the three DFT-D methods; it will be effectively used in the computation in DFT-D3(BJ). I recommand to use vdw_tol 1d-12 [Ha].<br /><br />If you want to include three-body terms you should set the variable vdw_tol_3bt as well, but to the best of our knowledge it has never been used in DFT-D3(BJ), only in DFT-D3. While, it would be in principle feasible to implement a damping function for this three-body term in DFT-D3(BJ), the three-body is costly to compute and gives a relatively small contribution to the total dispersion energy (~5%) and not necessarily in the good direction. Finally, while forces and stresses are available with this three-body term inside abinit, phonons and elastic constants computed in DFPT are not. <br /><br />Cheers, <br />Camilo and Beno√Æt</div>
