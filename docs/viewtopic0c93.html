				<div class="content">I am interested in using the potential file that is output by abinit for further analysis and I want to make sure that I understand the file and it's contents.  Currently when I integrate the contents of the file after multiplying by the proper charge density I still do not arrive at the proper value in the *.out file.  <br /><br />For example if I only consider the Hartree potential alone I intgrate to a value of exactly double what is shown in the *.out file.  As another example when I only consider the XC part fo the potential I integrate to a value that is just about 4/3 larger than the value in the *.out file.  <br /><br />Where in the code can I find the routines that are used to carry out this integration?  I would like to recreate these numbers in matlab to verify my understanding of these files and ensure I have not come across a bug in the abinit code.</div>

				<div class="content">The Hartree smells like<br />1) spin or<br />2) you have forgotten that each electron &quot;pair&quot; interaction should be counted only once<br /><br />The XC is more delicate, there is some double counting in all the potentials between \int n * v and E_tot. Have a look at the book by Richard Martin <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://electronicstructure.org/">http://electronicstructure.org/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />For the routines, you will have to walk around in the source, in particular inside rhotov.F90 to find the H+XC subroutines. The energy calculations are in a separate set of subroutines (in particular one called... energy.F90).<br /><br />grep will get you there.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
