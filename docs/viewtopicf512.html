				<div class="content">Hello out there!<br /><br />I'm trying to learn how to run abinit and tried the tutorials 1-4. <br />I figured, since there was a structure optimization for Silicon, that it would also be possible to perform this for Bismuth, which I have special interest in. However, after changing t34.in for my needs (acell and rprime mainly, I also use 83bi_halfso.psphgh pseudopotential) I discovered a terribly slow convergence in ngkpt, where, up to 8 8 8, there is no sign of convergence.<br /><br />Is there any way of speeding this up?<br /><br />thank you in advance,<br /><br />Patrick</div>

				<div class="content">Usually it's easiest to do the following:<br />1) use kptrlen to set a reasonable kpt grid, via: <br />kptopt 1<br />kptrlen 40<br /><br />now do a convergence check on ecut. For your pseudo on Bi I'm betting you'll need at least 25 if not higher (possibly a lot higher).<br /><br />2) Given the converged ecut value, now increase the kpt grid to check for convergence. Depending on the property, this might be a modest increase or very dense.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />What is the structure of Bi you want ? Because the unit cell seems huge to contain just two atoms. I would advice you to check your acell, rprim and the structure you get from abinit (you will find at the beginning the space group obtained).<br /><br />Moreover, you should set either kptrlen or ngkpt, not both.<br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />You do have a a number of problems in your input file--I think the main one is that you are trying to solve the problem in a hexagonal cell (the conventional cell for this structure) but you should be using the rhombohedral primitive cell. That's the one that has two atoms in it, the conventional hexagonal cell has 6. Your rprim input is not right for the hexagonal cell either, as it doesn't have enough digits (you should use 9). You may have disabled this check in your input but that also means you are forcing abinit to use a much lower symmetry group than the problem allows, leading to much longer calculations. Next, your kpt mesh is appropriate for FCC but not for this problem.<br /><br />Please take a look at the attached input file, I made it based on the Bi rhombohedral structure and ran it with the 83bi.5.hgh pseudopotential I downloaded from the abinit site, the optimization took about 60 seconds on my i7 machine and led to a reduction in cell lengths of about 2%, quite normal for LDA. <br /><br />Hope this helps,<br /><br />Joe<br /><br />[attachment=0]opt.in[/attachment]</div>

				<div class="content">Oh, I also wanted to point out several other problems:<br /><br />Bi is a metal so you should be using a metallic band occupation scheme, not the default--I used occopt 7. Also, as a metal the default value of diemac is appropriate (helps with convergence) so you can delete that variable from your input.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow, 22 minutes? What kind of computer are you running on, and how much memory does it have?<br /><br />what kptrlatt + shiftk do is implement a grid of k-points, using (I'm pretty sure) the Monkhorst-Pack scheme. shiftk makes the grid avoid the G point and the cell edges, that's why different shiftk sets are appropriate for different cell geometries. The different kptopt values also impose more or less symmetry on the resulting grid. For example if you use kptopt 1, all spatial symmetries + time reversal are used to reduce the total number of k points and use a weighted subset instead; kptopt 3 uses all k points; kptopt 4 uses space symmetries only, and kptopt 2 uses time reversal only. For ground state problems kptopt 1 is good, for problems with fields and other perturbations you have to use the other choices. <br /><br />kptrlen 50 comes a lot from experience; what happens is that kptrlatt defines a super-lattice in real space, LARGER than kptrlen, and the kpt grid is the reciprocal of the superlattice. So, the larger the kptrlen, the finer the k point grid. For small unit cells most ground state properties are pretty well converged at kptrlen 50 (because this length is large compared to the cell dimensions, more precisely, is large compared to the length scale over which the electronic properties are varying significantly); the exceptions might be things like stress and the shape of the Fermi surface in the case of metals (I work mostly on insulators so I'm biased that way). If you choose kptrlen way less than 50 the calculations are fast but you can get tripped up by the coarse mesh, and way larger than 50 the calculations take a long time. But without question, once your input file and pseuopotential choices are giving reasonable results, you have to do a kpt convergence check.</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds like your hardware is reasonable. How did you compile abinit? (that is, what compiler, what lapack/blas, what optimizations?) If you can, try to use Intel Fortran 11.1 on your computer, together with their MKL math libraries; using optimization -O2 or -O3 you will typically find best performance--</div>

For Bi, if it contains only 5 valence electrons (6s and 6p) I would guess the problem is that you need to include the 5d electrons also, I always need to do that in both Bi and Pb.</div>
