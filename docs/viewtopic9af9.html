				<h3>Phonon calculation in metals</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear all<br /><br />I would like to know if response function calculations in metals require extra care. I computed the full phonon spectrum of CdS (insulator) without any problems, but I can't manage to run a single RF calculation on AgS, which is metallic.<br /><br />I always end up with a segmentation fault, or some file that cannot be read, etc.<br /><br />Since these calculations require a lot of cpus, I cannot spend too much time testing every single parameter, so I ask for your advice. <br /><br />One of my concern is the value of occopt. Should I use occopt only in the first dataset (GS calculation)? Since subsequent dataset read the 1st dataset output wavefunction, I shouldn't use occopt right?<br /><br />Other concern is the value of istwfk. When the GS wavefuntions are read, abinit complains that the values of istwfk differ between the two dataset. Is it a problem?<br /><br />Finally, about the kpoint mesh. Since AgS is a metal, it requires a dense mesh, and that makes like 1000 kpoints in the BZ. Can I use a coarser mesh in the RF calculation compared to the fine grid of the GS calculation?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help<br /><br />Boris</div>

Are you sure it's not just an insufficient memory issue? The abinit estimation is not always accurate.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Since these calculations require a lot of cpus, I cannot spend too much time testing every single parameter, so I ask for your advice. <br /><br />One of my concern is the value of occopt.

When the GS wavefuntions are read, abinit complains that the values of istwfk differ between the two dataset. Is it a problem?<br /></div></blockquote><br />no, it completes the missing k-points. If it were a problem it would crash or complain with an error<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Finally, about the kpoint mesh.

Depends on the size of your system. Do you mean in the full BZ or the IBZ?<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
