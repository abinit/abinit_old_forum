				<div class="content">Hello Raff,<br /><br />As there are several versions of Abinit for Windows available  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> would you please tell me which one you downloaded: from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etsf.eu/">http://www.etsf.eu</a><!-- m --> or <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/">http://www.abinit.org</a><!-- m --> - explanations are different for each of them. The .exe binaries are command line utilities - you have to open a command prompt and launch them with the classic &quot;abinit &lt; input_file &gt;output_file&quot; scheme as explained in the docs. So when you say that you cannot &quot;run&quot; them, what do you do? what happens?<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">Hello<br />thanks very much Alain Jacques<br />I downloaded from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etsf.eu/">http://www.etsf.eu</a><!-- m --><br />I tested it in other computer, it is a virtual machine Windows XP in a Ubuntu 10.04 and it ran successfully, <br />I think.<br />I don't know now what happened in the former computer, Could be possible that it was related to the service pack?,<br />it reads &quot;was tested on windows xp system with sp3&quot;<br /><br />I can't say now what did the abinit displays in the other pc, then I when return to the other pc I post the message<br /><br />by the way, it has nothing to do with this theme but do you know how to find free the book<br />Electronic Structure of R. M. Martin that always is cited in the abinit tutorials???<br /><br />thanks again<br />rafael</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Raff,<br /><br />I built the etsf.eu packages on XP sp3 (i.e. 32 bit binaries) but it would be quite surprising that a service pack level changes the behavior. It has been tested successfully with Windows 7 too (32 or 64 bit version). I've provided separate distributions for Intel or AMD processors - it's maybe a bit confusing; anyway be sure to grab the right one otherwise the binaries will immediately fail. Another possibility - if you run Abinit in parallel with the provided mpiexec launcher - is that Windows firewall asks to authorize the application to communicate - say yes, nothing fishy here: MPI uses sockets between threads, nothing goes on Internet.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">... oh yes, Martin's book. Don't expect too much to obtain details here on how to scoop it from the net. Richard is a hero here; you wouldn't rip a hero? It's not cheap one but, being very readable, it's definitely recommended - borrow it from your local library, man, it deserves it and at least you won't catch a pdf virus.<br /><br />Alain</div>
