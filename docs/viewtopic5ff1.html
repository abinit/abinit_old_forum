				<div class="content">Hi Abinit users,<br>
<br>
I am using Abinit 9.0.4.<br>
<br>
(I created another post a few minutes ago for a similar calculation, but I believe that problem is unrelated to this one. I am not double posting to get my problem seen! Sorry if these two issues are related!)<br>
<br>
<br>
While trying to do a response function calculation, Abinit crashes complaining that istwfk is supposed to be 1 for all kpoints. I don't set this number in the input file and it apparently is supposed to be enforced automatically by Abinit for respfn calculations (the variables webpage says this!).<br>
<br>
The code crashes with the following error: <br>
<br>
 chkinp: Checking input parameters for consistency, jdtset=   1.<br>
<br>
--- !ERROR<br>
src_file: m_chkinp.F90<br>
src_line: 1282<br>
mpi_rank: 0<br>
message: |<br>
    Only the gamma point can use time-reversal and wfoptalg=4 or 14<br>
    Action: put istwfk to 1 or remove k points with half integer coordinates<br>
    Also contact ABINIT group to say that you need that option.<br>
...<br>

<br>
The q-point is 0.5 0 0. <br>
<br>
The input pert.in and gs.in files are attached.<br>
<br>
Any help is appreciated! <br>
<br>
Thanks a lot, <br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Dear Ty,<br>
Strange indeed, what about if you remove the nsppol, nspden and spinat flags since you have no magnetism?<br>
I would also remove completely autoparal flag because the error is associated to the algo used for parallelism and for DFPT paral_kgb is not working. Could you test this and tell us the result?<br>
Otherwise just set istwfk *1 as requested...<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Eric,<br>
Thanks again for the reply!<br>
<br>
I removed autoparal and it runs without crashing (so far, it is still running). nsppol, etc. had no effect. <br>
<br>
Apparently the problem occurred during the nscf (k+q) step with autoparal present. I should have noticed and mentioned that istwfk in the .abo file was correct (only 1's and 0's) for the response function dataset (with rfphon=1). It looks like Abinit was complaining about istwfk being wrong in the nscf (with k+q) run (1's, 3's, and 0's is what I saw). Does istwfk need to be only 1's in the nscf run?<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>
Ty</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ty,<br>
It sounds that at your nscf k+q, you end up with a grid that is not OK with time-reversal symmetry (well, as it is presently implemented). Just setting istwfk*1 or *0 works fine a the end?<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Eric,<br>
<br>
I removed autoparal and it solved my problem. I considered this satisfactory and didn't bother setting istwfk.<br>
<br>
For troubleshooting purposes, would you like me to try this?<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Ty,<br>
OK, thank you for your response, no need to test istwfk *1 if autoparall worked at the end, I'll keep in mind this potential problem.<br>
Best wishes,<br>
