				<h3>Calculating eigenvectors for the dielectric tensor of Hafnia</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Oct 23, 2020 9:29 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>qwin</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello <br>
I want to find the eigenvectors, the full dielectric (also the relaxed ion part) and piezoelectric tensor of Hafnia . So I followed the DFPT RF2 tutorial.<br>
<br>
first I generate a set of k points (kpt.in) like it is explained in the tutorial. I used these points for the new input file (kpt2.in), but here i get the following error message:<br>
<br>
<br>
--- !ERROR<br>
message: |<br>
    The file ./tmp/kpt2_o_DS1_WFK cannot be used to start the <br>
      present calculation. It was asked that the wavefunctions be accurate, but<br>
      at least one of the k points could not be generated from a symmetrical one.<br>
      dksqmax=    7.611730E-05<br>
      Action: check your wf file and k point input variables<br>
        (e.g. kptopt or shiftk might be wrong in the present dataset or the preparatory one.<br>
src_file: inwffil.F90<br>
src_line: 417<br>
<br>
I cannot understand what I should change for the kptopt or the shiftk. In the next steps I want to use the dieflag, piezoflag and the eivec. <br>
<br>
I work with PAW's, so my input file for kpt2.in looks like the following: <br>
<br>
kpt.in<br>
./out/kpt.out<br>
./tmp/tmp_kpti<br>
./tmp/tmp_kpto<br>
./tmp/tmp_kpt<br>
./ps/Hf.LDA_PW-JTH.xml<br>
./ps/O.LDA_PW-JTH.xml<br>
<br>
<br>
Can somebody explain me what is wrong in the file? <br>
Thanks a lot!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear qwin,<br>
At which dataset do you have this error message?<br>
A question: do you only want to compute dielectric constant and piezoelectric tensor? If so, they are only qpt=Gamma (0 0 0) point properties such that you do not need all these different qpt phonons to be calculated.<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you Eric for your fast answer!<br>
<br>
My main goal is to find the full dielectric tensor(purley electronic contribution + contribution from the phonon modes) and the full piezoelectric tensor. And more for interests it would be nice to generate also the phonon band structure.<br>
<br>
If i compare my result to other papers, I just found just the optical or purely electronic part of the dielectric tensor<br>
So I thought i would try calculating it with help of the RF2-tutorial and set the dieflag = 3.<br>
<br>
But It does not work. I generated 65 k points, I think I did it like the tutorial told it,  but i just can generate {DS1_DDB, DS3_DDB, DS4_DDB, DS5_DDB , DS6_DDB, DS7_DDB} (I expected 65 DDB files), afterwards it aborts. So kpt2.in generates just 6 files. I still merged them and tried to calculate the dielectric tensor,  But than i get the message:<br>
<br>
    Information is missing in the DDB.<br>
    The dynamical matrix number 8 cannot be built,<br>
<br>
Could you may give me a hint, what the best way is to calculate the full tensors.<br>
<br>
Thanks many time for you help!</div>

OK, this means that you should at least get the epsilon (elec and total) and piezo tensor right now with only Gamma point (if you forget about the phonon dispersion)?<br>
Regarding the phonon dispersion, I think you mist one point is that Abinit can use interpolation of phonon dispersion between DFPT calculated points (very useful for insulator to reduce the number of DFPT calculations). The interpolation is done with anaddb on a grid of q-point that has "brav"(<a href="https://docs.abinit.org/variables/anaddb/#brav" class="postlink">https://docs.abinit.org/variables/anaddb/#brav</a>) possibilities. The grid of DFPT should correspond to the ngqpt grid (2 2 2 or 4 4 4 or etc) with or without a shift (nqshft).<br>
In your case you can set brav to 1 and ngqpt to 2 2 2 (and no shift) to start with such that you need only Gamma and zone boundary points, which is already a good start. You can go to 4 4 4  to improve the interpolation but you don't need to do all qpt points with DFPT... (see section 4 of the RF2 tuto for the details).<br>
Best wishes,<br>

<br>
Thank you for your helpful answers!<br>
<br>
I think I need also to calculate the uniaxial and shear strain to find the whole dielectrical tensor. I am not sure if I did it correctly:<br>
<br>
Now I generate another dataset for the strain:<br>
<br>
#DS 4 Strain Pertubation of Q=0 <br>
#*************************************************<br>
qpt4 0.00000000E+00  0.00000000E+00  0.00000000E+00<br>
<br>
getddk4   2   #from the ddk part<br>
getwfk4   1    #from the ground state data set<br>
kptopt4   2   <br>
rfstrs4   3     #now i want uniaxial and shear stress<br>
rfphon4    1          <br>
rfatpol4   1 12       <br>
rfdir4     1 1 1    <br>
tolvrs4    1.0d-8     <br>
<br>
So at the end I have 11 Datasets: <br>

<ul><li>DS 1: Ground State</li></ul>
<ul><li>DS 2 : Response function calculation of d/dk wave function  (at Q=0)</li></ul>
<ul><li>DS 3 : Response function calculation of Q=0 phonons and electric field pert.</li></ul>
<ul><li>DS 4: Strain Pertubation of Q=0</li> </ul>
<ul><li>DS 5-11: Dynamical Matrix at wavevectors other than Gamma</li></ul>

Than i will merge DS 3 - DS 11 (so also with the strain DS). <br>
And than I can calculate  the full dielectric tensor with<br>
<br>
!Flags<br>
  dieflag 4<br>
  elaflag 3<br>
  instrflag 1<br>
!Wavevector grid number 1<br>
 brav 1<br>
 ngqpt 2 2 2<br>
<br>
Kind Regards<br>

				<div class="content">Dear Qwin,<br>
The last error message you report is quite clear I think: you have an unstable phonon mode at Gamma (probably polar) such that the dielectric is not defined.<br>
It is possible that the space group in which you are running corresponds to a high-symmetry phase which is not stable and you'll not be able to compute the dielectric constant of this phase due to the presence of unstable modes.<br>
But the unstable phonons could be an artefact of the numerical calculation if you did not impose the acoustic sum rules, did you set asr flag in your input (I do not see it)?<br>
