				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />We have noticed a difference in the value of the magnetization for NiO when using PAW and non-colinear magnetism (nspden=4) as compare when non-PAW pseudopotentials are used. <br /><br />NiO is a collinear spin system. When using non-PAW pseudopotentials, we obtain the same difference in the integrated atomic density meaning the same local magnetic moment, a value of 1.35.<br /><br />When we use PAW pseudopotentials, the colinear calculation (nspden=2) gives the same value of local moment as the non-PAW calculations. The difference between the non-PAW and PAW is only 3% which can be explained by the different pseudopotentials.<br /><br />When the calculation is done using non-colinear (nspden=4) and PAW, the local magnetization is lower. We obtain 0.85 which is very different than the 1.35 of the other methods. We note also that the convergence is a lot more difficult in nspden=4 with PAW as compare to non-PAW and PAW in colinear.<br /><br />The outputs files are attached to this post. We can provide the input and log files if needed. At the moment, the Forum allows for only 3 files to be attached to each post. All the calculations are with the 6.2.2 version of ABINIT. We had the same problem with 6.0.0.<br /><br />We are wondering if there might be some problems in the implementation of the non-colinear magnetism in PAW? We are willing to help find the problem but we wanted to have the opinion of other users on this issue first.<br /><br />Michel</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Michel,<br /><br />A quick answer... to go further I have to go deeper into your files.<br />Concerning the magnetic moment differences:<br />- the difference between non-PAW and PAW (1.35 vs 1.30) is probably due to the difference in the radius used to integrate the density (2.0 for non-PAW, 2.3 for PAW); you could try to impose ratsph...<br />- if I compare paw_nspden2 and paw_nspden4, I find that the total energies are similar, as well as the occupation matrices rhoij (and psp strengths Dij).<br />So, the two calculations seem to be the same... we could suspect a problem in the integration; to be confirmed...<br /><br />Marc</div>
