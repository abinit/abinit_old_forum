				<h3>Issues with phonon band structures</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Fri Jun 25, 2010 4:55 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>jrh</strong></div>
				<div class="content">I have been trying to calculate phonon band structures for Si and Ge using the Troullier-Martins pseudo potentials. The results I get agree largely with<br />what is published in the literature (for example, Wei and Chou, PRB 50, 1994, 2221), but there are some small differences. First, the lowest bands<br />which are exactly the same in the paper between the L and Gamma points are slightly different in my calculation (both for Si and Ge). Second,<br />there is an additional &quot;peak&quot; between the W and L points which is not present in the paper. I have varied the number of q vectors, but the results<br />are almost identical. I have attached the input for Si and the resulting band structure plots.<br />Any hint on what might be wrong is appreciated.<br /><br />Jörg</div>

Yes, indeed. I suspect that nband 6 is the cause of the problem,<br />perhaps there is a degeneracy between the 6th and 7th band in some of the k point you are sampling.<br />Could you try simply to use nband 4 ?<br /><br />Best,<br />X</div>

				<div class="content">I have tried your suggestion, but it has made things much worse. I have attached a pdf file containing the phonon band structure I am trying to<br />reproduce and the results of some of the attempts I have made. The closest I can come to the published results is when I run with a 12x12x12<br />grid of q vectors, but even there I still have differences between W and L as marked in the pdf file. Reducing the number of bands result in<br />a complete catastrophe.<br />I am not sure if the observed behavior has something to do with the way the q vectors are choosen. I am using the following procedure:<br />- I run an Abinit calculation with kptopt 1, ngkpt 8 8 8, nshiftk 1, shiftk 0.0 0.0 0.0<br />- I take the k points printed in the output of this run and copy them to the qpt keyword in the response function input where I use<br />nkpt 0, kptopt 3, ngkpt 8 8 8 for the k point<br />which is as I understand the procedure you have suggested in the second Abinit response function tutorial. Maybe the q vectors have to<br />be choosen differently. Therefore, I would appreciate any explanation and how this is supposed to be done in Abinit.<br /><br />Thanks for your help,<br />Jörg</div>

				<div class="content">Perhaps a minor point. If you do not specify the shiftk explicitly it will be nshiftk 1 shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5, which will probably break symmetry for an FCC system. Set this to the usual nshiftk 4 shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5   0.5 0 0  0 0.5 0   0 0 0.5, or use a shift of 0 0 0 to check.<br /><br />matthieu</div>
