Normally you should set only the irreducible atoms with natrd &lt; natom, and let abinit find the symmetric positions. If you give all positions, and they are not perfectly symmetrized, abinit will duplicate atoms which are not perfectly (to within tolsym which defaults to 1e-10) on the high symmetry points.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>for spgroup X and chkprim 0:<br /><br /></div></blockquote><br />This is not the way to go - you want a primitive cell.

				<div class="content">If you want an AFM system, you need to specify spinat - this will make spin up and down atoms inequivalent by normal symmetries, and the chkprim will not be an issue any more (the space group is magnetic with more operations)<br /><br />From your snippets I can't tell whether this would be enough: no idea what the full set of positions and cell look like once the spgroup has been used.

				<div class="content">Hello once again,<br />I think my problem is a little knowledge about ABINIT. I have studied on simple systems like fcc, hcp, or bcc, but now I don't know how to prepare input for any larger unit cells. Let's forget my earlier posts and take an example:<br /><br />I would like to do some calculations for BaFe2As2 compound which forms structure in space group Fmmm (# 69). I found in papers wykoff positions of Ba (0,0,0), Fe (1/4,1/4,1/4) and As (0,0,036). All my attempts to prepare input failed. Other software takes only wykoffs and primitive or unit cell is built automatically, but copies of that xreds and rprims are useless in ABINIT. Primitive cell is formed by 5 atoms, unit cell has 10 atoms.<br /><br />I found rprims and site symmetries at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b24.html">http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/b24.html</a><!-- m --> and Bilbao Crystallographic Server, and prepared the input for hypothetical compound SrNi2Si2 in the same structure:<br />........<br /># SrNi2Si2 in space group 69<br />natom   5               <br />ntypat  3               <br />znucl   38 28 14        <br />typat   1 2 2 3 3<br />acell   20.5 20.7 34.0<br />rprim   0.0  0.5 0.5    <br />        0.5  0.0 0.5     <br />        0.5  0.5 0.0<br />xred   0.0     0.0     0.0            <br />        0.25    0.25    0.25           <br />        0.75    0.75    0.75<br />        0.0     0.0      0.3538         <br />        0.0     0.0     -0.3538<br /><br />(the rest of input is unimportant)<br />.........<br /><br />but output is then:<br />.........<br /> inpspheads : deduce mpsang  =   3, n1xccc  =   1.<br /><br /> invars1m : enter jdtset=     0<br /> invars1 : treat image number     1<br /><br /> symlatt : the Bravais lattice is aP (primitive triclinic)<br />  xred   is defined in input file<br /> ingeo : takes atomic coordinates from input array xred<br /><br /> symlatt : the Bravais lattice is aP (primitive triclinic)<br /><br /> symlatt : the Bravais lattice is aP (primitive triclinic)<br /> symspgr : the symmetry operation no.   1 is the identity<br /> symspgr : the symmetry operation no.   2 is an inversion<br /> symspgr : spgroup=   2  P-1   (=Ci^1)<br /> getkgrid : length of smallest supercell vector (bohr)=    2.899138E+01<br />       Simple Lattice Grid<br /> symkpt : found identity, with number  1<br />  inkpts : after getkgrid, nkpt=           0<br /> invars1: mkmem  undefined in the input file. Use default mkmem  = nkpt<br /> invars1: With nkpt_me=    4 and mkmem  =     4, ground state wf handled in core.<br /> invars1: mkqmem undefined in the input file.

Use default mk1mem = nkpt<br /> invars1: With nkpt_me=    4 and mk1mem =     4, ground state wf handled in core.<br /><br /> Symmetries : space group P-1 (#  2); Bravais aP (primitive triclinic)<br /> getkgrid : length of smallest supercell vector (bohr)=    2.899138E+01<br />       Simple Lattice Grid<br /> symkpt : found identity, with number  1<br />  inkpts : after getkgrid, nkpt=           4<br /> chkneu : initialized the occupation numbers for occopt=    3<br />    spin-unpolarized case : <br /><br />(and so on)<br />........<br /><br />ABINIT found only 2 symrels, but Fmmm has 8 symrels. Is it good for final results of calculations? Every other combinations (non-primitive unit cell and so on) lead to space group 2 or 1, but how can I attain the proper space group? I think I missed the point.<br /><br />with regards,<br />Maciek</div>

				<div class="content">acell are the lengths of the lattice vectors you give with rprim<br /><br />they are <strong class="text-strong">not</strong> the conventional lattice constants, unless you set things up that way. In your case the cell is tetragonal (not cubic) so you should either<br />1) set acell 1 1 1 and put the rprim properly by hand (simplest)<br />2) use a different unit cell, e.g. with c along the z axis (so acell(3) = c) and then adjust the fractional coordinates of the first 2 lattice vectors along z to fit the c/a ratio you want<br /><br />and in any case make sure that the xred are correctly represented wrt the unit cell you chose.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
