That would likely cause an error such as the one you have. <br /><br />For further advice, it would be helpful that you repost the most recent version of your input and the corresponding .log, so that we can more precisely troubleshoot the problem. <br /><br />Jonathan</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />What abinit complains about is that the numbers in your rprim aren't precisely enough respecting the symmetries of your space group (spgroup 172). You need to put more significant digits so that the first and second vectors in rprim have the same norm. Four your given values, we have :<br /><br />9.43072300 - sqrt(-4.71536150^2 + 8.16724569^2) = 0.00000000351103<br /><br />Abinit whants the number to be precise up to 16 significant digits. So, recalculate your second vector more precisely and it will be OK. You can alternatively just use <br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>acell 9.430723 9.430723 6.917214<br />angdeg 90 90 30<br /></code></pre></div><br />(dropping rprim altogether) and you will avoid that kind of problems. <br /><br />Same thing for the atomic coordinates (xred) : you only give 4 significant digits. This will quite surely make abinit crash. Give 16 digits that respect the symmetry group for each atomic coordinate, to be safe. <br /><br /> By the way, what kind of calculation are you trying to run? I ask because I see in your imput file :<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>kpt 2 2 3</code></pre></div><br />which is needed only if you want to run the calculation at a specific k-point in the Brillouin zone and, without kptopt 0, is not even read by the code anyways. If you want to run a calculation with many k-point (to do a ground state calculation), use something like<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>kptopt 1<br />ngkpt 2 2 3<br />nshiftk 1<br />shiftk 0.0 0.0 0.5<br /></code></pre></div><br />and do a convergence study on ngkpt (as you do on ecut, for instance), as described in tutorial 3 (see <a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.10/tutorial/lesson_3.html" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.10/tutorial/lesson_3.html</a>). <br /><br /> Good luck,<br /><br />Jonathan</div>

				<div class="content">It is ok to use the experimental data as a starting point for your relaxation, but in the end, your simulated data may be different from experiment, depending on the approximations you're using. And here, we're even only talking about significant numbers, which is even many orders of smaller lower than what you will get as agreement between experiment and simulation. So, just follow jolafc's advice, and use <br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>acell 9.430723 9.430723 6.917214<br />angdeg 90 90 30<br /></code></pre></div><br /> to be sure to have the right starting symmetries. Or, recalculate your second vector as to have its norm equal to the first one up to 16 significant digits.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everybody,<br />I think you did not understand me. I am obliged to use the experimental coordinates because I have not another ones. And the abinit accepts only the &quot;perfect&quot; positions to fit space group symmetries. So, have anyone some ideas how to correct the atoms positions to be accepted by the program.

				<div class="content">Maybe I still misunderstand you, let's try again <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />The experimental positions you have are <em class="text-italics">almost perfectly</em> symmetric. But ABINIT needs <em class="text-italics">perfectly</em> symmetric positions. So, just make them perfect by hand (using one of both techniques mentioned before). This is no problem, since, after a structural relaxation using LDA, GGA etc, the position of the atoms will change to have the lowest <em class="text-italics">simulated</em> energy configuration. This configuration will, if the the approximations implied by the simulation are sufficient, be very close to your original <em class="text-italics">experimental</em> configuration. If you don't do such relaxation and keep the experimental positions of the atoms <em class="text-italics">as is</em>, you may end up having huge forces on the atoms which is no good working base for future simulations.<br /><br />I hope this clears things up, otherwise, I still didn't understand your issue...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />For abinit to generate all the atomic coordinates in the primitive cell from the irreducible set, you need to put <br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>natom 44<br />natrd 7<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />and not <br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>natom 7</code></pre></div><br /><br />Now, I realize you have only 42 atoms in your cell. Only, abinit finds 44 from your 7 positions and spacce group 176. I also see only 42 atoms when checking a 3D representation of the 44 atoms abinit generated from your 7 experimental positions. That means there are 2 aotms among the 44 that are found 2 times. You need to find which and adjust the position of the atom they were generated from so that abinit understant that it is at a more symmetric positions than he thought. <br /><br />So, change your input file, run it with abinit (with a low cutoff, for instance 54eV, since the result is unimportant, you just want abinit to generate the symmetrized coordinates), find the 2 coordinates that appear 2 times, find which of the 7 irreducibles cooridnates generated these and correct it. <br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Jonathan</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Your ecut is incredibly low ... 54 eV is ... 2 Hartrees. Even for silicon, you should use an ecut of minimum 8 Hartrees, depending on the property you aim to look for. I would start by increasing the ecut to 30 Hartrees or so (you have oxygen so its at east this cutoff energy). You should then make a convergence study (try with ecut 30, ecut 35, ecut 40 .... until the properties you are looking for do not change anymore within some tolerance ... You can check also with a very high ecut : convergence study from 30 to 60 by step of 5 and then one calculation with ecut 100 for example). Note that if you omit the &quot;eV&quot; in the ecut definition, the default units is Hartrees (1 Hartree ~ 27.211 eV).<br /><br />You might do the basic tutorial lessons before doing complex systems ... : <a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.10/tutorial/welcome.html" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.10/tutorial/welcome.html</a> =&gt; lesson 1, 2, 3 and 4, you will learn many things that you do not need to ask here. And these do not take more than 1 or 2 hours each.<br /><br />I hope it helps!<br /><br />David</div>

Only when I use ionmov 2 and optcell 1 the programme gives:<br />Kinetic energy = 0.00000000000000E+00<br />Hartree energy = 0.00000000000000E+00<br />XC energy = 0.00000000000000E+00<br />Ewald energy = 0.00000000000000E+00<br />PspCore energy = 0.00000000000000E+00<br />Loc. psp. energy= 0.00000000000000E+00<br />NL psp energy= 0.00000000000000E+00<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Etotal= 0.00000000000000E+00<br /><br />Other information on the energy :<br />Total energy(eV)= 0.00000000000000E+00 ; Band energy (Ha)= 0.0000000000E+00<br /><br /><br /><br />I have tied to add ionmov 2 and optcell 1 to t11.in in lesson 1 to see. the same problem with H2. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" />  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> <br />When I do a ground state calculation. It is Ok but in the moment I add ionmov/=0 it gives me those 00000000....<br />I do not understand why. Normally, the programme shoould be able to calculate the enrgy after cell optimization. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> <br />I hope i am not making you bored with my &quot;stupid&quot; questions of someone who wants to have results without spending time reading help file as you see.<br />Be sure that if I am posting a question that mean I read all the forum subjects and I did not find my aim.<br />thank you for your comprehension <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">Were you able to fix your issue? If so, can you please share final version of your .in file? I am a 10th grader.  I need fluorapatite file to interact with TiO2 file. With my skill level I am able to create TiO2 .in file. fluorapatite for now is beyond me. Would appreciate if you can share its file. Thank you.</div>
