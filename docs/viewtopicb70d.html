				<h3>[Solved] AtomPAW 3.0.1 and PAW2 Tutorial</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I'm currently doing the tutorial on the generation of PAW datasets using atompaw. First, an <a href="http://www.abinit.org/acl_users/credentials_cookie_auth/require_login?came_from=http%3A//www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.6/tutorial/lesson_paw2/atompaw-usersguide.pdf" class="postlink">ID is required</a> to access the atompaw user manual. I searched for a way to create an account on the abinit website but I didn't find it. Maybe the link should be modified to point towards <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/~natalie/papers/pwpaw/atompaw-usersguide.pdf" class="postlink">another URL</a>?<br /><br />Then, it seems that the 3.0.1 version of the atompaw code does not behave (at all) like the one in the tutorial. For instance, it does create only two files: an NC file and another file with the name of the element studied, in which one can find some information, but nothing compared to what the tutorial claims. I downloaded atompaw 3.0.1 from <a href="https://launchpad.net/atompaw/+milestone/3.0.1" class="postlink">launchpad.net</a>. Do I need to get another version of atompaw to be able to do the tutorial?<br /><br />Thank you all for your help<br /><br />Boris</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Boris,<br /><br />I was quite puzzled by the login screen too. The page will be corrected soon but there is no need to look for a download link of the manual ... you have it already: it is (somewhat) hidden in your own Abinit installation tree - look in abinit-6.6.1/share/doc/abinit/tutorial/lesson_paw2/<br /><br />For the second part, there is something that I don't understand. Atompaw should behave like in the tutorial. When I launch Atompaw - the one prepared with abinit-6.6.1 - with the first doc/tutorial/lesson_paw2/Ni.atompaw.input1 as input, it outputs NC, Ni, Ni.GGA-PBE-paw.abinit, Ni.GGA-PBE.xml, Ni.atomicdata, Ni.atompaw.input1, compare.abinit, density, dummy, fthatpot.0, fthatpot.1, fthatpot.2, fthatpot.3, fthatpot.4, ftkin.1, ftkin.3, ftkin.4, ftkin.5, ftkin.6, ftvloc, logderiv.0, logderiv.1, logderiv.2, logderiv.3, potential, test.log, tprod.1, tprod.3, tprod.5, vloc, wfn1, wfn10, wfn2, wfn3, wfn4, wfn5, wfn6, wfn7, wfn8, wfn9 files i.e. about 6 MB of data as expected. If you only get 2 files then there is probably something wrong with your binary.<br /><br />No need to download from launchpad; latest release is available from <a href="http://archives.abinit.org/plugins/atompaw-3.0.1.tar.gz" class="postlink">http://archives.abinit.org/plugins/atompaw-3.0.1.tar.gz</a> and it is the one that is downloaded and compiled with the current production abinit-6.6.1 - look in your tarballs directory or <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>grep atompaw-3.0.1 configure</code></pre></div> to check<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Alain,<br /><br />Thank you for your answer. Following what you said, I ran some test and I found out that my input file is probably wrong. When I run my compiled version of atompaw on the input file from the tutorial, it does create a bunch of files like written in the tutorial. But with my input file, only two files are created. So there's probably a mistake in it. I'll try to figure it out on my own before posting again ^^<br /><br />Thank you again.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi again,<br /><br />It was actually just a convergence problem. Atompaw just stopped because it couldn't reach any convergence when calculating projectors with Blochl's scheme. Unfortunately, the ending message was not very explicit!<br /><br />I tried with the Vanderbilt's scheme and it went fine.<br /><br />Thanks again for your help<br /><br />Boris</div>
