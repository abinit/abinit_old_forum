				<h3>Atom position in a Si slab, Calculation of a surface</h3>

				<div class="content">I'm trying to perform a calculation of Si surface energy and I got the following questions:<br />1.How to I build a unit cell with a couple of layers of Si and vacuum (including dependence on crystallographic directions 100 or 111)? In tutorial 4 there is a solved problem for Al in 100 direction, but how do they find coordinates for atoms in a unit cell? And what if i want to add one more layer or change a direction for 111?<br />2. Another question is how to calculate surface energy or energy per atom or per unit cell out of a total energy given by an ABINIT output?<br />Say, there is following data, again from Tutorial 4: etotal                                      -6.2622251351E+00 in Hartree<br />                                                                              surface energy per unit cell       0.015885 Ha = 0.432eV <br />How do they devide it??</div>

				<div class="content">Well, it seems I have to reformulate a question:<br />The solved problem for Al (Tutorial 4) is as following. If we want to consider bulk Al we build unit cell with one atom in it:<br />       xred     0.0  0.0  0.0<br />This is crystal clear.<br />But if we consider a surface (1 0 0) with two layers of atoms and vacuum above them we need to add two more atoms into the unit cell<br />      xred   0.0 0.0 0.0<br />                0.0 0.0 0.5<br />                0.5 0.5 0.25<br /><br />and this is not obvious for me how to choose these coordinates. CAN ANYONE HELP PLEASE???<br /><br />Now, I want to repeat these calculations (surface) for Si. <br />Again if we consider bulk Si it sufficient to use 2 atoms per unit cell<br />        xred  0.0 0.0 0.0<br />                 1/4 1/4 1/4<br />So far so good.<br />But, How the unit cell will look like if I want to consider a couple of layers of Silicon? (say 2 for instance in the most simple 100 direction)<br /><br />I would really appreciate any contribution!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear deepdrew, <br /><br />So the idea is that Abinit will replicate your primitive cell in the 3 directions. If you want to simulate a slab you can do for exemple:<br /><br />3 layers of Si then 3 layers of vacuum then by replication it will again be three layer of Si etc..<br /><br />To simulate a real slab you do not want the different layers of Si to interact so you want enough vacuum between them. <br /><br />For example you could put something like <br />acell 6 6 60 Bohr (random number here but you get the idea.<br /><br />You can see that the dimension in the z direction is 10x larger. It mean you can put 10 layers. If you want to work in reduce coordinate you will have to put<br />something like <br />xred 0 0 0<br />       0 0 0.1<br />       0 0 0.2<br /><br />This mean that you will have 3 atoms space in the z direction by 0.1*60 = 6 Bohr.  The fact that you put nothing for the 7 other layers means that it will be vacuum. <br /><br />You off course have to put xred numbers in agreement with your rprim variables. <br /><br />For you second question I guess it would look <br />xred 0 0 0<br />       1/4 1/4 1/8<br /><br />This will put a vacuum layer in between. <br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Samuel</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Samuel,<br />Thank you so much for your input and your answer! <br />It really helps to grab the idea more clearly!<br /><br />I guess this becomes a bit more tricky if we change a direction on (111)? Just curious.<br /><br />And ones again,<br />What is the formula that allows for devision of total energy from ABINIT output to obtain surface energy?<br /><br />example from Tutorial 4:       etotal -6.2622251351E+00 in Hartree<br />                                             surface energy per unit cell 0.015885 Ha = 0.432eV <br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Andrii</div>

				<div class="content">The surface energy is simply the difference of energy between the bulk and the surface calculation.<br /><br />For exemple:<br /><br />If I get a total energy of -20 Ha for the primitive bulk cases (1 atom per unit cell for exemple) and a total energy <br />of -58 Ha for three layers of Si and 7 layers of vacuum it means that the surface energy will be 2 Ha (20 Ha times 3 = 60 Ha minus 58 Ha = 2Ha).<br /><br />Usually the total energy of the system with the vacuum will be higher in energy (thus less stable) than the bulk system.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Samuel</div>
