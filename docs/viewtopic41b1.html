				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I am trying to download some of the Troullier-Martins psuedopotential files linked to from your download page but I am experiencing some problems. Clicking the link causes an empty web page to load so I attempted to log in to the ftp server directly and received the following error message: <br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>Connected to abinit3.pcpm.ucl.ac.be.<br />421 Service not available.</code></pre></div><br /><br />I would greatly appreciate your assistance in obtaining these psuedopotential files.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Anton Heyns<br />Researcher<br />Department of Chemistry<br />The Ohio State University</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Alain,<br /><br />Thank you for your prompt reply. I'll give two examples of downloads that I've tried and attempt to explain how the fail clearly, if there's any specific additional information that you require I'll be more than happy to oblige.<br /><br />From the page: <a href="http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/lda_tm" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/downloads/psp-links/psp-links/lda_tm</a><br />When I attempt to download the psuedopotential for Niobium, link <a href="http://www.abinit.org/downloads/Psps/?text=../Psps/LDA_FHI/fhi" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/downloads/Psps/?text=../Psps/LDA_FHI/fhi</a><br />I receive a &quot;file not found&quot; page linked below.<br /><br /><a href="http://imgur.com/cKWmG.png" class="postlink">http://imgur.com/cKWmG.png</a><br /><br />When I attempt to download an element like Lithium with link <a href="ftp://ftp.abinit.org/pub/abinitio/Psps/LDA_TM.psps/03/3li.pspnc" class="postlink">ftp://ftp.abinit.org/pub/abinitio/Psps/LDA_TM.psps/03/3li.pspnc</a><br />a new empty page opens and no further activity occurs. No downloads are initiated at this time. In order to diagnose this problem I tried logging in to the ftp server first using an anonymous login (user: anonymous password:email_address) and then using my Abinit forum username and password. In both cases I receive the error message: 421 Service not available. <br /><br />Since the downloads appear to work for you but not me perhaps the issue is network related, if you are on the same network as the servers perhaps there's a setting preventing outside access.<br /><br />Once again, thank you for your help,<br /><br />Anton</div>

				<div class="content">Link should be renamed [SOLVED-NOT!] <br /><br />The link is broken and it is network related. When I go to the University of Pittsburgh and attempt to download pseudopotentials everything works fine. When I try the same thing from home, I either get empty pages downloaded,<br />or a statement that my system could not connect with the server. This has been confirmed about 10 times, so every time<br />I go to Pittsburgh, I try to download whatever I might need. Very inconvenient though since Pittsburgh is 40 miles away.<br /><br />Mike</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Mike,<br /><br />Sorry for your obvious exasperation.<br />Abinit has quite a decent uptime but it may be down from time to time. As you seem to experience a different behavior from your home and from your workplace, it's arguably not a server side problem. When you mentioned &quot;from home&quot;, I assume that you mean your 71. ... Comcast IP address; I checked, it is not blacklisted here. I also checked that downloading from outside of the site is working - it is. I also assume that I would be inundated with complains if it was the case - I'm not. Would you be so kind to specify which link is broken and your IP address when it failed?<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">I too have Comcast internet service at home. It may be something as simple as the fact that the Comcast name server just<br />cannot locate the Abinit server in Europe.<br /><br />I just tried from a friend's house that has Verizon FIOS internet service and everything worked fine. So it's Comcast's fault,<br />not yours.<br /><br />Mike</div>
