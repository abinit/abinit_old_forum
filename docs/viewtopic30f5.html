				<div class="content">I am trying to assign the correct amount of time to my phonon calc.<br />Here is an example:<br /><br />I have a very low symmetry 20 atom unit cell.   I am going to specify rfatpol 1 20<br />How many iterations of the 2nd deriv energies will there be?<br />3n+3?  or more?    <br /><br />I ask this because I did a calc w/ 20 atoms, knew it would be a little less than 1 hr per iteration and assigned 63 hrs to the job.<br />But, then the iterations contiuned on to a 64th iteration.   And the job timed out.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />The number of iterations depends on many other parameters besides the number of atoms. For me it is very hard to estimate it.<br /><br />You can set the maximal number of iterations so that calculation finishes in assigned job time. But then you risk the precision.<br /><br />Also, have in mind that you have to calculate the scf procedure for each atom at each q-point you set up. If you figure out how much time it takes to calculate the complete scf procedure for one atom at one q-point, then you can multiply it by the number of atoms and by the number of q-points to estimate the total time for response part of the calculation. And it would still be a very rough estimation, since the response scf depends on atomic species (pseudopotential) and q-point coordinates.<br /><br />You have &quot;some&quot; testing to do.<br /><br />Igor</div>
