				<h3>Charge Density Waves with Abinit. Possible?</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I'm asked to calculate Charge Density Waves (CDW) with Abinit.<br /><br />I kind of understand the very basics of this phenomenon: in conductors<br />a small rearrangement of the ions will lower the total energy by creating<br />a small bandgap at the fermi energy.<br /><br />Can somebody help me find the important parameters to do this with Abinit?<br /><br />I think one only needs a supercell with dimensions approximately ~ 1/kf<br />(with kf = wavevector k at fermi level) and let the ions relax. The lowest<br />energy should then exist when the ions arrange themselves such that<br />the new arrangement has a lattice constant which creates a gap at the<br />fermi level.<br /><br />Is it then possible to find the CDW simply by doing an ionic relaxation in a<br />large enough supercell?<br /><br />Or is my thinking too simplistic?<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Rob.</div>

				<div class="content">The simplest way to see charge density waves is to do a phonon calculation with the appropriate phonon q, and finding an unstable mode. If you want to do a frozen CDW, it's possible too, and you'll have to get a supercell corresponding to q (as you suggest), with appropriate displaced atoms, and see what comes out. If your q is incommensurate, this may be impossible!<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the explanation.<br />Whether it is commensurate or not will then also depend on how large size of a<br />supercell I can choose, doesn't it? There is always a supercell (however large enough)<br />which has the periodicity of both the original structure and the new CDW structure.....right?<br /><br />In case I can do a 'frozen CDW', should I then find this by letting the ions relax?<br />Will the mimimum energy procedure easily rearrange the ions such that for a metal<br />a gap is created right at the fermi energy?<br />If yes, I may need to switch off Abinit's use of symmetry, since that may prevent<br />Abinit to find the CDW arrangement?<br /><br />I just wonder if somebody has experience with this. I kind of understand the basics<br />how a CDW comes to existence and what (basic) effects it has.....but don't see<br />clearly how a DFT can be used to deal with this.<br /><br />Rob.</div>

The easiest is to displace a few atoms, but of course this biases the direction of the relaxation. If you have the phonons, as I suggested in the last post, you know which displacements will go soft and you can try each of them to see which gives you the lowest energy result.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I just wonder if somebody has experience with this.
