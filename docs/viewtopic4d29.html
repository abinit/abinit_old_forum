				<div class="content">I have been trying to calculate the dielectric function of HgS. After checking convergence, I did plot the real and the imaginary part of the dielectric function and the agreement with experiment is very good EXCEPT that at low energies I am getting unusual results. The imaginary part becomes negative, while it should go to zero. At the same time, the real part is going upward when it should got downward. I did check K point convergence as well as Ecut and the result does not change. I think this results is unphysical, basically because if the Img and real part are related through the Kramers-Kroning relation and if the Imag should go to zero, then the Real part should also go to zero. Is there anything I am missing in the calculation? is the a way within Abinit to avoid this problem?<br /><br />Thanks a lot!</div>

				<div class="content">That is very strange.<br />Which program are you using for the optical spectra?<br /><br />There are several ways in abinit to get it, <br />In NC pseudo-potentials, you can use:<br /><br />optics, conducti or the gw code, there are also external codes as Yambo and DP.<br />They all in principle should give the same result.<br /><br />But, you could make a test with another program, to see if the error is related to the program you are using<br />or to the groud state calculation.<br /><br />Best<br />Tonatiuh</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Tonatiuh, <br /><br />let me spell a bit more what is my problem.<br /><br />I did use the optics code by following the tutorial and changing the variables to fit my problem. In my case, I did have to use<br />the scissor operator to match the electronic band gap. After the calculation, the agreement with experiment<br />is really good but as I said, the only thing that I do not like is that the imaginary part of the dielectric<br />function should be zero up to 1.2 eV and in my case it becomes negative (just a tiny bit) and the real part should decrease<br />and it increases. In order to check if the problem comes from some type of convergence, I did massage the data and put<br />at hand zeroes on the imaginary part. By using the Kramers-Kroning relation I was able to obtain the right behavior on the real part.<br />I will try the Yambo code..<br /><br />Thanks!</div>
