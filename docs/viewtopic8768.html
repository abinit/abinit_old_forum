				<div class="content">Dear abinit users<br />I have a question about DFT + U, I read in the abinit tutorial just the example of LDA + U, my question is: can I use GGA + U or not?<br />Thanks to all</div>

				<div class="content">I would be interested in an answer to the same question. They say that LDA+U is really DFT+U, but why not GGA+U?<br /><br />I have seen a paper that mentions DFT+U and GGA as part of the computational setup, so it's likely that this is doable in general. But not sure whether it can be done in ABINIT. I haven't tried it myself.<br /><br />Secondly, the whole point of such extensions is improved accuracy of the XC functional approximation. Then why do we have 'two tracks' of accuracy enhancement: 1) better functionals (e.g., HSE06) 2) addition of '+U'? In other words, what can '+U' do that HSE06 can't, and what can HSE06 do that '+U' can't? What are the pros and cons of each enhancement.<br /><br />And is it possible to have HSE06+U?</div>

				<div class="content">Dear fhssn1 (and lakhal),<br />GGA+U works too, no problem.<br />+U correction is made on a single orbital of a given atom, then only this orbital is corrected. Different values of U can be used, this is up to the user to test the effect of U on the physical properties.<br />In short, hybrid functionals works by using a given amount of exact exchange Hartree-Fock (HF) and compensate double counting. The amount of exact exchange is fixed for a given hybrid flavor (HSE06, B1WC, etc), thought the user can change it. This correction is applied to all orbitals of all the atoms.<br />Note that HF calculation in plane wave is time consuming w.r.t. DFT+U, such as hybrids can be from 100 to 200 times slower than DFT+U.<br />Which one to chose depends on what you want to calculate, if DFT+U is enough then use DFT+U.<br />I advise you to read the seminal papers of the different hybrid functional flavors for more details.<br />All the best,<br />Eric</div>
