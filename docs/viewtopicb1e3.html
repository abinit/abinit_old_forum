				<div class="content">We are doing some testing on different pseudopotentials and I have found that revPBE give<br />some cases superior results than normal PBE but I do not find any pseudo or code to<br />create revPBE pseudos to be read from Abinit. Does anybody knows any code or place<br />to find those?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />-aldo.</div>

				<div class="content">Yann,<br />I don't think APE is for PAW (NC-pseudopotentials only).<br /><br />Aldo,<br />if you want to use rePBE with atompaw or uspp2abinit you have to hack these codes (replace Pbe routines by revPbe ones). But this probably needs some work.<br />I have begun to include libXC in atompaw but this work is not finished and it is (unfortunately) not on top of my stack...<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Marc</div>

				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />  Would it be correct, that in order to use any functional from libxc library (for example, AM05) one need to have a pseudopotential generated for this specific type of functional? Can I use PBE (PAW) pseudopotential and ixc value, that activates an AM05 functional? From some papers (unfortunately, where VASP was used), people use PBE datasets for PBEsol or AM05 functionals. Can we do the same in ABINIT?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /> P.</div>

In some cases it's harmless, but as AM05 adds non-trivial things compared to PBE, I think it's not a good idea. To some extent you are counting on a cancellation of the xc contribution from core electrons with the valence, and if these have been included in the pseudopotential using a different functional, then the results will be wrong.<br /><br />You can do the same in abinit: just set ixc by hand and it will override the pseudopotential input xc type.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Mattiew,<br /><br />  Thanks for reply.<br /><br />   I indeed try to active AM05 functional from libxc while using PBE-PAW pseudopotential.

				<div class="content">Seems a bug. Indeed, the exchange AM05 is working properly, and also the correlation AM05,<br />see the test in tests/libxc/Input/t04.in , but they are not tested together in this automatic test ...<br />Strange ...</div>
