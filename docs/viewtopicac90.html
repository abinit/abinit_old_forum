				<h3>monitor temperature during molecular dynamics</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello<br /><br />I recently tried Abinit's MD engine (v6.4.2, ionmov 8) to test the Nose-Hoover thermostat. However, the code does not seem to print the temperature at each time step. Is there an input variable to activate this which I may have overlooked? Thank you for your time.<br /><br />best,<br />Steve</div>

				<div class="content">To partly answer my own question: First, a correction: I did test ionmov 13<br />because, according to the documentation, only for this case are Nose-Hoover<br />chains implemented (I'd like to do NPT-MD according to MTTK [1] anyway):<br /><br />ionmov 13<br />optcell 2<br />dtion 20<br />nnos 3<br /># defaults<br />qmass 10 10 10<br />bmass 10<br />mditemp 300<br />mdftemp 300<br /><br />Entering some write statements in 95_drive/moldyn.F90, I found that the<br />temperature (ktemp/kb_HaK) is actually constant at 300.0 from the first time<br />step on (with different qmass = 10 .. 50). This puzzles me a bit because I<br />expected the temperature to fluctuate around its mean value. Maybe I'm missing<br />something very obvious regarding the MTTK method. If I read the code right, the<br />atomic velocities are updated at each time step to produce the target<br />temperature, yes?<br /><br />I do not want a temperature ramp from mditemp to mdftemp over nstep steps, but<br />thermostat the system from the beginning. Is setting mditemp==mdftemp correct<br />here for that purpose?<br /><br />And: What exactly are the units of qmass and bmass, i.e. are they the Q and W<br />parameters from [1]?<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />best,<br />Steve<br /><br />[1] Mol.

				<div class="content">Thanks for answering.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>if T=const it sounds more like the velocities are being rescaled, instead of a thermostat being used, which I agree should give fluctuations around the mean value. Have you checked the subroutine to make sure a NH thermostat is being used?<br /></div></blockquote><br />I checked again and yes, a thermostat is beeing used. Rescaling is done only at<br />time step 0 to bring the atoms to the requested start temperature. For each MD<br />step, I calculated the temperature from the atomic velocities (&quot;KIN+POT.En.&quot; -<br />etot or &quot;vel&quot;) and it fluctuates as expected. However the mean is always<br />somewhat (50 --100 K) higher than the target temp, which may be due to<br />non-optimal thermostat masses. <br /><br />Thanks again.<br /><br />best,<br />Steve</div>

				<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />The temperature is usually several hundrads higher than the target temperature, when using  ionmov=13 optcell=2.<br />For example, when I set 1000 K, it finally give the average value of 1400K.<br />Usually, how to solve this problem?<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br />Best regards.<br /><br />Riping Wang<br />2018.10.24</div>
