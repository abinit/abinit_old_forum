				<div class="content">Hi Konstantin<br /><br />Maybe your issue has something to do with the fact that the acoustic sum rule is still not satisfied, even with anaddb. I have run a series of calculations on different materials and had the same issue, i.e. when the first three acoustic phonon frequencies are exactly zero, I obtain a good phonon spectrum, but when they're not, the frequencies are wrong.<br /><br />I don't know why anaddb is not imposing the acoustic sum rule. I don't think it's related to anaddb because when I set rfasr=1 in abinit, the acoustic sum rule is not satisfied either.<br /><br />I'm going to investigate this and I'll let you know.<br /><br />Also, always check that your boxcut(ratio) is greater than 2. If it's not, change your cutoff until it is. This has been reported and should be corrected in a future release.<br /><br />Boris</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Boris,<br /><br />Thank you for the hints. The weird thing is that the ASR is obviously satisfied with NCPPs, while it does not with PAW. It seems to be strange because anaddb operates with a precomputed Hessian. I'll appreciate any feedback concerning the issue. Have a good holidays.<br />Best regards,<br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes it is strange<br /><br />What's puzzling me even more is that I calculated phonon frequencies at Gamma in different materials and the acoustic sum rule is satisfied when there is only one atom per unit cell. When I build a supercell with two atoms per unit cell, the asr is not satisfied anymore and the frequencies go nuts.<br /><br />I first thought that the asr was not satisfied when natom&gt;1, but now I just tried in UO2, with 3 atoms per unit cell, and the asr is satisfied with reasonable phonon frequencies at Gamma (compared to small displacements).<br /><br />And as you said it seems to occur only with PAW.<br /><br />Could you please post your input file for the NCPP calculation?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">The NCPP input file for the phonons at Gamma attached; PSPs were taken from FHI database. At the end of the file you find extracts from abinit and anaddb outputs with the values of the phonon frequencies. As you see the ASR is not satisfied in the abinit output, while when anaddb has done its job the three low-frequencies are almost zero (although I used a rather soft convergence criterion for the geometry tolmxf=2.0d-5 in that calculation).<br /><br />I also noticed that the strange behaviour of PAW depends on the number of atoms in unit cell. Thus, everything went well for Li2O, three large negative frequencies were obtained for a-quartz, four/five for a-cristobalite, and a lot for a-V2O5. Again, no problem was encountered for either system in NCPP calculations.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everybody.<br /><br />The thread was inactive for quite a long time. Any movements?<br /><br />Very recently, I've tested the DFPT phonon calculations for alpha-quartz  at the LDA/PAW level with v7.8.2 and have obtained the same weird result: large negative frequencies. Obviously, the issue, which is the root of the thread, was<br />not fixed (the release announcement of the lastest 7.10.2 version does not mention any changes in this direction).<br /><br />On the other hand, LDA/PAW DFPT calculations of the electronic dielectric tensor seem to work. At least, the results for alpha-quartz are as follows:<br /><br />LDA/NCPP<br />    2.492037    0.000000   -0.000000<br />    0.000000    2.492037    0.000000<br />   -0.000000   -0.000000    2.522437<br /><br />LDA/PAW<br />    2.524434    0.000001   -0.000000<br />    0.000001    2.524436   -0.000000<br />    0.000000   -0.000000    2.557826<br /><br />Hope this information will help tracing the source of the problem.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi everybody<br /><br />We've been working a lot on DFPT+PAW and we have corrected a number of things in the code, in particular issues related to symmetries. The 7.10.4 version should work well on many systems, so for those of you who have not tried it yet, I suggest you do so and let us know about the results.<br /><br />Some additional information: looking at the abinit frequencies, it is normal that the acoustic sum rule is more satisfied in NCPP than in PAW. This is because of the PAW formalism that calculates some integral quantities on the fine PAW grid. However, after going through anaddb, the acoustic sum rule should be perfectly satisfied. If it's not, it means that the calculation ran into an issue. In a &quot;good&quot; calculation, the first three abinit frequencies (not the anaddb frequencies) should be close to zero, but not exactly. From my experience, a &quot;good&quot; calculation has the first three frequencies approximately equal to 0.3-0.7 THz. It can be positive or negative. If you have larger values, then something probably went wrong.<br /><br />In addition, we have noticed that in supercells with 50 or more atoms, the acoustic sum rule is not perfectly satisfied even after going through anaddb. It is currently under investigation.<br /><br />Next production version of abinit will be further improved related to the DFPT+PAW part. Stay tuned!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Dr. Boris Dorado,<br />Thanks a lot for working on DFPT+PAW problem! I may assume the problem partly (or fully) resolved. Talking about subject structure using LDA PAW datasets taken from JTH project and using acoustic sum rule the negative frequencies vanishes in 7.10.5 version. But the value of acoustic frequencies in ABINIT output still rather high. Its of order 40-20cm-1. Actually one is -40 while other two approximately 20. The stress tensor seems to be homogeneous:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp;Cartesian components of stress tensor (hartree/bohr^3)<br />&nbsp; sigma(1 1)=&nbsp; 1.06276443E-06&nbsp; sigma(3 2)=&nbsp; 0.00000000E+00<br />&nbsp; sigma(2 2)=&nbsp; 1.06276443E-06&nbsp; sigma(3 1)=&nbsp; 0.00000000E+00<br />&nbsp; sigma(3 3)=&nbsp; 9.90957041E-07&nbsp; sigma(2 1)=&nbsp; 0.00000000E+00</code></pre></div><br />The plain wave basis is definitely full:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>ecut 40<br />pawecutdg 80<br /></code></pre></div><br />But I should say the system is extremely compact, as the closes distance between Si and O atoms is of order 3Bohr while the sum of paw radius is bigger:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp;chkpawovlp : WARNING -<br />&nbsp; PAW SPHERES ARE OVERLAPPING !<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Distance between atoms&nbsp; &nbsp;1 and&nbsp; &nbsp;8 is&nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;3.03025<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; &nbsp;1 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;1.90945<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; &nbsp;8 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;1.41465<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;This leads to a (voluminal) overlap ratio of&nbsp; 1.80 %</code></pre></div><br /><br />Reducing paw radius in PAW datasets often leads to increasing of the plane-wave basis size, and I not sure it worth to do.<br /><br />So, my question is it normal to have -40cm-1 of acoustic mode frequency?

				<div class="content">Hello Eugene,<br /><br />40 cm^-1 makes approximately 1.2 THz. Usually my frequencies at Gamma in the abinit output are around 0.5 or 0.6 so it's the same order of magnitude. But you should have the first three modes nearly degenerate in frequencies so my guess would be that something went probably wrong.<br /><br />I have two more advices for DFPT users :<br />1. At the end of the DFPT run, for each qpoint, you have the fourteen components of the derivative of the total energy (just grep 'Fourteen'). At the end of this section, you have the value of the 2nd derivative of the total energy &quot;2DETotal = XXXX Ha&quot; then, two lines below, you have the same 2nd derivative of the total energy calculated in a non-variational way &quot;non-var 2DETotal = XXXX Ha&quot;. <strong class="text-strong">These two values must be close!!</strong> Usually in my calculations, the difference between the two values is lower than 10^-5 Ha. Sometimes, in very complex systems (actinides, no symmetries, defects, etc.), I have a difference of ~10^-2 Ha. If the difference is larger than that, <strong class="text-strong">then your calculation is wrong</strong>. If it happens, you may first want to check the convergence of your ground state wave functions (tolwfr at least 10^-20). Usually it solves the problem.<br /><br />2. The other important point is that the kpoint grid needs to satisfy the space group symmetry. However, when it does not, abinit doesn't say anything, the calculation runs smoothly but the results are wrong. The indication for this &quot;bug&quot; is that the acoustic sum rule is absolutely not satisfied (which I believe is the main subject of this topic <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />). In order to solve this issue there is a little bypass that I found and that you should use while we are correcting the issue: just use rfstrs=3 in your calculation at the Gamma q point. If the kpoint grid does not fully respect the space group symmetry, then in this case abinit will stop and will display an error message saying that the kpoint grid must be changed. Just change your kpoint grid so that it satisfies this rule. And always use rfstrs=3  in order to be sure that you have the correct k point grid.<br /><br />If your calculations follow these two points, you should have better phonon spectra <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />As for the GGA implementation, the development will start very soon!</div>

In case of JTH &quot;potential&quot; the one for Oxigen is far softer, Rpaw=1.4, so high ecut is mostly because system is very compact the minimal distance is about 3a.u, that's very small distance between O and Si atoms.<br /><br />Anyway, I will try to perform geometry optimization and response calculations with higher ecut and let you know.</div>

But I did not found how to set up E_loc value in section governing the scheme used to get VPS(r) (local) pseudopotential from all-electron effective potential Veff(r) using &quot;ultrasoft&quot; pseudization scheme (without norm conservation constraint). I've found the E_loc value acts only on  &quot;Vloc energy&quot; in output file. The high values also produces ghost states some time. Should I use E_loc as high to reduce  &quot;Vloc energy&quot; or is there some other rule to choose E_loc.<br /><br />I do understand the questions is out of topic, but I'll be appreciate  a lot for any hint.<br /><br />Eugene.</div>
