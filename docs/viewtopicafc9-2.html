				<div class="content">Dear All<br /><br />I've tried to run the self-consistent gw calculations, by using the &quot;tests/wannier90/Input/t03.in&quot; for Si as a guide but running it only the gw part. <br />In order to speed up the convergence study of gw corrections with respected to the number of self-consistent iterations, I tried reducing the &quot;nkptgw&quot; from 8 to 1 <br />and used only &quot;kptgw&quot; at gamma point. The remaining part of the input were kept the same as the original run, excepting that the parts involving Wannier interface <br />were commented out. Please see the attached files: t03_gw_8kptgw.in and  t03_gw_at_gamma.in, for details. The psp was 14si.pspnc.<br /><br />However, I've found that the &quot;E^GW_gap&quot; for the gamma point in the 2nd iteration were different between the runs using nkptgw=8 and nkptgw=1, as given below.<br /><br />*For the Run using nkptgw = 8, kptgw = 0 0 0 and others 7 kptgw's <br />   GW iteration                1st           2nd<br />      E^0_gap                   2.521      3.312<br />      E^GW_gap              3.328      <span style="color: #FF0000">3.428</span><br />      DeltaE^GW_gap    0.807      <span style="color: #FF0000">0.116 </span>    <br /><br />*For the Run using nkptgw = 1, kptgw = 0 0 0 only <br />   GW iteration               1st           2nd<br />      E^0_gap                  2.521      3.312<br />      E^GW_gap             3.328      <span style="color: #FF0000">3.120</span><br />      DeltaE^GW_gap   0.807     <span style="color: #FF0000">-0.192</span><br /><br />Is the above result a common thing for self-consistent gw calcuations? Or is there something wrong? <br />I cannot figure out what might cause the difference in the E^GW_gap. <br /><br />Looking forward to your replies,<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Thanusit<div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">It's normal as the self-energy and the QP density are obtained by integrating the <br />wavefunctions in k-space. <br />In your gamma-only calculation only the wave-functions at Gamma have been updated<br />while the remaining k-points in the mesh are not updated and are treated at the Kohn-Sham level.<br />This is erroneous and the final SCGW results are not reliable.<br /><br />Long time ago I've added a check in order to stop the code if SCGW is done on a subset <br />of the k-mesh used in the KSS file.<br />Unfortunately  this prevented users from performing one-shot calculations on top of SCGW results.<br />I will reintroduce a warning to warn the user that not all the k-points are included in the SCGW run.</div>
