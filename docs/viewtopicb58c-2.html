				<div class="content">Dear ABINIT friends,<br /><br />     I want to calculate the energy barrier of a hopping oxygen atom on a ZrO2(111) surface. The initial and final configurations have been optimized. When I do the string calculation, a strange error occurs.<div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>--- !ERROR<br />src_file: m_paw_tools.F90<br />src_line: 211<br />mpi_rank: 0<br />message: |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PAW COMPENSATION DENSITIES ARE OVERLAPPING !!!!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4 pairs of overlapping atoms.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The maximum overlap percentage is obtained for the atoms&nbsp; 55 and&nbsp; 58.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Distance between atoms&nbsp; 55 and&nbsp; 58 is&nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;3.29921<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; 55 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;2.50000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; 58 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;1.41465<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | This leads to a (voluminal) overlap ratio of&nbsp; 0.93 %<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; THIS IS DANGEROUS !, as PAW formalism assumes non-overlapping compensation densities.<br />...<br /><br /><br />--- !ERROR<br />src_file: m_paw_tools.F90<br />src_line: 223<br />mpi_rank: 0<br />message: |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Action: 1- decrease cutoff radius of PAW dataset<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR&nbsp; 2- ajust &quot;pawovlp&quot; input variable to allow overlap (risky)<br />...<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;abi_abort: decision taken to exit ...<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD<br />with errorcode 14.<br /><br />NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.<br />You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on<br />exactly when Open MPI kills them.<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------</code></pre></div><br />The version of ABINIT I used is 8.10.1. The PAW potential is JTH-v1.1 PBE table from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.abinit.org/psp-tables">https://www.abinit.org/psp-tables</a><!-- m -->. In addition, the input file ZrO2surf.in, log file log (renamed log.out for uploading), out file ZrO2surf.out and file file (renamed cZrO2_s.in for uploading) have been attached in order to reproduce this problem.<br /><br />It is noted that I find some related topic:<br />1. <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic8815-2.html?f=8&amp;t=3974&amp;p=12054&amp;hilit=string+calculation#p12054">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=3974&amp;p=12054&amp;hilit=string+calculation#p12054</a><!-- l --> <br />    I regenerate the PAW file. However, this problem isn't solved by this method.<br />2. <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopica40e.html?f=8&amp;t=3986&amp;p=12328#p12328">viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=3986&amp;p=12328#p12328</a><!-- l --><br />    The pawovlp value has been increased to 25 as suggested Eric. The calculation is running. <br /><br />Has anyone else ever encountered such an issue? Any comments would be most appreciated.</div>

The problem in this topic has been solved when I set the &quot;pawovlp&quot; to 25. I also believe that the problem will be solved if we use the option pawovlp=-1. <br /><br />    In addition, I don't know where can we find the pawovlp value of the last step? log file? or out file? In other words, if there is no warning about pawovlp, can we think no overlap among the calculated atoms? Your reply is appreciated.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Ke Tong</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Ke Tong,<br />I don't see an option to print the overlap of the spheres when they don't go beyond the max...<br />You could add some writing lines in the source file &quot;src/65_paw/m_paw_tools.F90&quot; where you have the chkpawovlp module, which makes the test of overlaping and print the error message. This is something we could add as a printing option in future version.<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>

I'm so happy that I can't help sharing with you. <br /><br />    I search &quot;paw_tool&quot; in log file in an occasional chance and find the &quot;pawovlp&quot; value, like this <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>--- !WARNING<br />src_file: m_paw_tools.F90<br />src_line: 213<br />message: |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PAW SPHERES ARE OVERLAPPING!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2 pairs of overlapping atoms.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The maximum overlap percentage is obtained for the atoms&nbsp; 14 and&nbsp; 51.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | Distance between atoms&nbsp; 14 and&nbsp; 51 is&nbsp; :&nbsp; &nbsp;3.57360<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; 14 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;1.41465<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | PAW radius of the sphere around atom&nbsp; 51 is:&nbsp; &nbsp;2.21000<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | This leads to a (voluminal) overlap ratio of&nbsp; 0.06 %<br /></code></pre></div> even if they don't go beyond the setting value (Thanks for the developers of ABINIT).
