				<div class="content">Dear all,<br />        we performed G0W0 calculations starting form a PBE KS system for cubic ZnS. The direct band gaps are 2.00 (PBE), 2.77 (ppa), and 3.33 (cohsex) eV. Our G0W0 results are obviously underestimated with respect to other G0W0 ones reported in the literatures. For instance, the ppa G0W0 result is around 3.5 eV. We increased the density of the k-mesh and the number of the energy bands. However, the underestimate becomes even large. The same underestimate was found in the case of cubic ZnSe. Should we start our G0W0 calcultions from PBE+U KS systems? The following is the input file we used to carry out the G0W0 calculation. It will be appreciated very much if someone gives us some instructions.

				<div class="content">Does your pseudopotential for Zn consider 3s and 3p electrons as valence ? This is of the utmost importance for the final result.<br /><br />It has been published several times that G0W0 for ZnO, ZnS, and ZnSe underestimates quite much the experimental band gap. You may turn to self-consistent GW to improve the agreement.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br />Fabien</div>
