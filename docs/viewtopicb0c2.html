				<h3>Atomic structure relaxation</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I would like to ask if it is possible to perform full atomic position relaxation in Abinit. More specifically what I mean by this is that I do not have information on the space group of crystal structure in mind and wish to allow all atomic positions to relax fully so that the result converges to a particular space group corresponding to the minimum total energy at ground state. However, Abinit seems to perform relaxation based on the symmetry groups imposed in the starting structure, i.e. I am not able to start from a random space group and hope that the end result gives the correct space group.<br /><br />Is it also possible to perform structure relaxation by fixing two lattice parameters and allowing the third lattice parameter to relax to minimize energy?<br /><br />Thanks so much for your kind attention!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Nawzad,<br /><br />Thanks so much for your reply. What I meant was something similar to having optcell=2. However, optcell=2 allows for full relaxation subject to symmetry imposed in the initial guess structure. Here I do not know the symmetry groups of the materials of interest and wish to find those out through minimizing energy in DFT. Therefore full relaxation without symmetry imposed would be ideal. <br /><br />Does it make sense for me to try perturbing all the atomic positions so that there is very minimal symmetry and nearly-full relaxation of nuclear positions can be done? Or must I resort to identifying all the potential space groups of the material of interest through experiments, other computational studies etc, and then perform DFT calculations accordingly?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>
