This is a current development of BigDFT stand-alone and will be available with version 1.4. The inclusion of this future version inside ABINIT is not planned yet.<br /><br />Regarding the convergence study, yes, wavelets requires also to check convergence. With respect to two main parameters, wvl_hgrid, which define the quality of the grid (like ecut defines the quality of the plane-wave projection) and wvl_crmult which is related to the spatial expansion of the grid. Typical values for hgrid varies from 0.50 Bohr to 0.25 Bohr, depending on your pseudo (silicon is happy with 0.45 while carbon prefers 0.35 for high quality results). The typical values for wvl_crmult are betwen 4 and 7 (multiplying factor).<br />An important point regarding to convergence study with wavelets is that, both <strong class="text-strong">wvl_crmult and wvl_hgrid should be improved together</strong>, otherwise the error raised by one will mask the improvement of the other one.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>dcaliste wrote:</cite>2) There is some gain in CPU time and hardware resources like memory if I use<br />BigDFT instead of plane wave formalism to deal with systems containing many<br />atoms and a vacuum layer?<br /></div></blockquote><br />Yes, mainly. The better improvements are definitely achieved for dipolar surfaces since the Green function treatment in the Poisson solver is exact in that case, while the vacuum part for super-cell approachs must be wide. Moreover, there no convergence study with respect to vacuum size to be done.<br />But, currently, wavelets in ABINIT are not using the surface conditions. This is nevertheless possible with BigDFT stand-alone.</div>
