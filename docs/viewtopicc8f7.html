				<div class="content">Dear Abinit users,<br /><br />I want to calculate the band structure and wavefunctions in a BZ path with k-points having reduced coordinates exceeding 1. <br />When I do such calculation Abinit stops claiming that the reduced coordinates of kpoints must be between -1 and 1.<br />Is there a way to bypass this problem?<br /><br />I know that I can use symmetry operations to take the point back inside the first BZ, unfortunately I want to avoid such procedure.<br /><br />To be more specific<br />I want to calculate the band structure of graphene on Pt that have a 2x2 direct space supercell with respect to freestanding 1x1 graphene. Then I want to exclude the bands deriving from the folding of bands in the reduced BZ and compare the obtained band structure with the one of freestanding graphene. <br />I know that I can obtain only the &quot;unfolded&quot; bands by calculating the superposition of the 2x2 wavefunction with the 1x1 ones. So I have to calculate the band energies and wavefunctions on exactly the same k-points in both the 2x2 and the 1x1 calculations. However for the 2x2 calculation this implies that some kpoints have reduced coordinates exceeding 1.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Michele</div>

				<div class="content">hai<br /><br />I am also doing band structure calculation on intrinsic undoped graphene. <br />I am now trying to study the adsorption of gas molecules on graphene supercell.<br />But I am not clear of how to define the unit cell of a 4 by 4 graphene supercell. Can you help me to create a 4 by 4 supercell.<br />How I need to define acell and rprim variables for creating a 4 by 4 supercell. <br /><br />Regards<br />Seba</div>
