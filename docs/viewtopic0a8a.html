				<div class="content">Hallo,<br />a comparison of abinit-7.0.5 and abinit packaged by debian 4.3 evidenced different results.<br />So I ran the tests and found that many of them did not pass.<br />I found the same on abinit-6.12.3 and 4.8.5 and so began varying the compilation options:<br />gfortran4.7 gfortran4.4, with and without openmpi<br />atlas openblas and netlib<br />I also tried a different machine but with no luck.<br />In the input that started all,<br />abinit compiled by me gives several warnings about density being lower than -0.05,<br />abinit from debian package gives different etot and no such warning.<br />What might the problem be?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />The segmentation fault is probably related to a bug in your implementation of BLAS. Configure abinit with the option --enable-zdot-bugfix and recompile. You may still have problems with Wannier functions if you use them.<br /><br />About the consistency between Abinit versions.<br />A great care is devoted to the reproducibility of the results but it is unwise to do comparisons between version 4 and 6/7. There have been changes to the default values of several variables and this may affect the results. And I wouldn't do comparisons between absolute total energies but rather between differences.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">Putting<br />nsim 1<br />eliminates the density &lt; -0.05 warnings and gives reasonable results again in version 7.0.5,<br />and equal to results from versions before 5.4.4p.<br />The same does displacing an atom by a physically irrelevant quantity to break symmetry.<br />  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> So compilation options and libraries had nothing to do with the problem.<br />From the manual, I had deduced nsim has only to do with editing of coordinate nuclei,<br />but apparently it is not so.</div>

				<div class="content">Configure options and libs explain the segfaults you experienced, not the difference between versions<br /><br /> nsim? I don't know that one ... are you talking about nsym? <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> By specifying nsym 1 you force to have no symmetry i.e. only identity (and I would add symrel to be sure which one is applied). Which spacegroup comes out of your test?<br />Looking at your input file, I can hardly recognize the bulk gold crystal in such a tiny cell. IMHO, gold is fcc, spacegroup 225 with a cell length of 4.0785A - according to Wyckoff. So I would define the crystall as ...<br />ntypat 1<br />znucl 79<br />acell 3*4.07825 angstrom<br />natom 1<br />typat 1<br />rprim 0.0 1/2 1/2<br />      1/2 0.0 1/2<br />      1/2 1/2 0.0<br />xred 0.0 0.0 0.0<br /><br />and let the symmetry finder do its job.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, nsym I meant.<br />It is a 3 layer sqrt(3)xsqrt(3) slab, coordinates are from previous calculations on crystal (the program).<br />It was written so, because ready for geometry relaxation and an adsorption study.<br />The symmetry and multiplicity are recognized correctly, imo<br />--------------------------------<br /> symlatt : the Bravais lattice is hP (primitive hexagonal)<br /><br /> chkprimit : COMMENT -<br />  According to the symmetry finder, the unit cell is<br />  not primitive, with multiplicity=  3.<br />  This is allowed, as the input variable chkprim is 0.<br />.........<br />    nsym =        36  n1xccc =         0  ntypat =         1  occopt =         4<br />.........<br />           symrel      1  0  0   0  1  0   0  0  1       1  0  0   0  1  0   0  0  1<br />                       1  0  0   0  1  0   0  0  1      -1  0  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1<br />                      -1  0  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1      -1  0  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1<br />                      -1  1  0   0  1  0   0  0  1      -1  1  0   0  1  0   0  0  1<br />                      -1  1  0   0  1  0   0  0  1       1 -1  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1<br />                       1 -1  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1       1 -1  0   0 -1  0   0  0 -1<br />                      -1  1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1      -1  1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1<br />                      -1  1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1       1 -1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1<br />                       1 -1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1       1 -1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1<br />                       0 -1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1       0 -1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1<br />                       0 -1  0  -1  0  0   0  0  1       0  1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1<br />                       0  1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1       0  1  0   1  0  0   0  0 -1<br />                       0 -1  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1       0 -1  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1<br />                       0 -1  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1       0  1  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1<br />                       0  1  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1       0  1  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1<br />                       1  0  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1       1  0  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1<br />                       1  0  0   1 -1  0   0  0  1      -1  0  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1<br />                      -1  0  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1      -1  0  0  -1  1  0   0  0 -1<br />----------------------------------<br />My question is still, why should automatic symmetry recognition change the results?</div>
