				<h3>PAW+phonons</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Jun 13, 2013 9:16 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>ksmirnov</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello everybody.<br /><br />Trying to test the phonon calculations with LDA + PAW I've encountered the following problem. Everything went well as soon as the calculations dealt with a small size cell system (such as Li2O). However, trying to test the calculation of phonons at Gamma for alpha-quartz and alpha-cristobalite, I obtained three large negative frequencies (-83 cm-1) for the former structure and four (!) negative frequencies (-162.7, -130.1, -125.2, -90.4 cm-1) for the latter. The situation becomes worse for a-V2O5, where a third of phonon frequencies are negative. Of course, the complete structure optimization is done before performing the phonon calculations. PAW files were taken from ATOMPAW database; small radius LDA file was used for oxygen to avoid overlapping of PAW spheres.<br /><br />Did anybody notice similar problem. Thank you.<br /><br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Konstantin,<br /><br />First of all, did you check the convergence with ecut with these Atomic data on your systems?<br />If yes, did you check if the SCF for each perturbation is converged up to the tolerance you required in your input (when looking at &quot;ETOT&quot; in the log or ouput files for each perturbation)?<br /><br />All the best,<br />Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Eric,<br /><br />Since I did the calculations to test the capability of ABINIT, I did not test the convergence with ecut. The ecut used was 25 Ha with pawecutdg 50 Ha. The information in the atompaw database shows that such cut-off should be enough. By the way, increasing ecut to 30 Ha does not change the results.<br /><br />I inspected the log and output files. The SCF converges after ca. 30 steps for each perturbation (for alpha-cristobalite), the convergence criterion tolvrs=1.00E-15.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Konstantin.</div>

Pseudopotential calculations (*.fhi TM NCPP) using EXACTLY the same criteria give correct results. I 've just tested ecut=40 Ha (pawecutdg is always taken as 2 x ecut) for alpha-cristobalite -&gt; the same weird results, i.e. four large negative frequencies.<br /><br />Best wihes,<br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Igor,<br /><br />I have a question for code developers. Is response function is implemented for PAW in abinit 7.1.2 version. I have been waiting PAW implementation for phonon calculation for long. I can calculate phonon frequency using norm conserving plane wave pseudopotential without problem. But if I use PAW pseudopotential, my calculation crahses when it reaches to 3DTSET ie., perturbation with repsect to homogeneous electric field. I checked this even in latest version abinit 7.2.1., the problem remains same. This time error message is different than in abinit version 6.12.2.<br /><br />I would be so grateful if you could reply me soon.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Suvas</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Konstantin,<br /><br />The phonon frequencies calculated at Gamma with PAW+DFPT are wrong because of the breaking of the acoustic sum rule. This is related to the fact that the system should be invariant by translation and it is actually not the case. The phonon frequencies therefore need to be corrected and this can be done with the anaddb code (see tutorial) by setting ASR = 1.<br /><br />Some other hints: always use the latest version of abinit because the PAW+DFPT part still changes and set USEXCNHAT to 1. Also, phonon frequencies are strongly dependent on the quality of the ground-state wavefunctions, therefore you should converge your wavefunctions to at least TOLWFR = 1.0D-22. Convergence of the wavefunctions can be improved by increasing NLINE (I set it to 20)<br /><br />Good luck<br />Boris</div>

Is there any educated guess?<br /><br />Konstantin.</div>

				<div class="content">pawecutdg doesn't necessarily need to be 2*ecut. It just has to be greater than ecut. It should be set as a convergence criterium, like the kpt mesh or the cutoff energy.<br /><br />As for your results, something is troubling me. You said that you analyzed the frequencies with anaddb, but anaddb is supposed to impose the acoustic sum rule, therefore you should have the first three frequencies set to zero. Plus, what you are quoting in your posts look like the abinit results printed in the output file, are you sure you're looking at the output of anaddb?<br /><br />Boris</div>
