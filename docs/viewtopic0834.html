				<div class="content">Hi all (long time no see!)<br /><br />can someone provide a rough estimate for the memory needed per processor during the screening calculation and the BSE calculation? For example, running nbands with nkpts on nprocs, how much memory/processor should be available? These calculations seem to be running well except it's very hard to plan ahead how which computer to run on and/or how much memory to request from the queuing system, for a given calculation. Any guidance would be much appreciated.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Matteo,<br /><br />I am interested in the develop version support for NC pseudos with more than one projector. How can I download this version?  BTW, can you comment on the GW calculation using PAW? From the tutorial, for GW calculation, PAW with 3 projectors for each angular momentum channel is requited. Therefore one need construct their own PAW to do GW calculations?<br /><br />Best,<br />Xiaoming Wang<br />University of Toledo<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>gmatteo wrote:</cite>Hi Joe, it's good to see you again.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>can someone provide a rough estimate for the memory needed per processor during the screening calculation and the BSE calculation<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />It's possible to obtain an estimate of the memory requirements by using max_ncpus &gt; 0 in the input file.<br />The code will print in the main output file a Yaml document with the estimated parallel efficiency and the memory requirements <br />for all parallel configurations up to `max_ncpus`<br />It works for GS calculations, DFPT, GW and BSE.<br />In the case of GS runs with paral_kgb=1, you also have the values of npfft, npband etc associated to the different number of MPI processors.<br /><br />Note that the code exits immediately after the output of the &quot;--- !Autoparal&quot; section, so this feature is not compatible with multiple datasets.<br />The memory reported is in Mb and is expected to be smaller than the actual size.<br /><br />The memory requirements in the GW/BSE part can be decreased with fftgw and gwmem (in particular gwmem = 10).<br />I recommend gwpara=2 in Screening and Sigma since gwpara=1 is not able to distribute the wavefunctions (gwpara=2 is now the default value in Abinit8).<br /><br />In the BSE code, the size of the excitonic Hamiltonian scales with the number of MPI processes but the wavefunctions are not distributed.<br />It's possible to bypass the calculation of the SCR by using the model dielectric function (mdf_epsinf).<br /><br />BTW- I've recently added support for NC pseudos with more than one projector (in the last version of trunk/develop it's possible to<br />use inclvkb = 2 to compute [Vnl, r] with oncvpsp pseudopotentials).
