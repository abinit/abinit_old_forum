				<div class="content">Dear Abinit users<br /><br />I have seen in the Abinit website that by setting the input variable &quot;prtwant&quot; to 1, Abinit-WanT interface can be used, where it is also mentioned that 1 corresponds to the version of the WanT (1.0.1). Since the current version of WanT 2.5.0, what value I have to give for &quot;prtwant&quot; to use the Abinit-WanT interface.<br /><br />As it is also mentioned that &quot;prtwant&quot; value of 2 corresponds to the use of Abinit-Wannier 90, so what I understands is that by using the value of 2, it does not mean the interfacing of WanT 2.5.0 with Abinit.<br />I would like to know how can I interface the current version of WanT code with Abinit.<br /><br />It would be of great help if someone who knows this could help me in this regard.<br /><br />Thanks in Advance<br />Seba</div>

				<div class="content">Hi prtwant 1 was to be used with an old version of WanT.<br /><br />The new ABINIT-WanT interface is inside WanT.<br />There is a convertor from the WFK ABINIT format to ETSF:<br />Use it as:<br />[want]/bin/wfk2etsf.x   o_DS1_WFK <br /><br />This will convert o_DS1_WFK into a wavefunction file in etsf format.<br /><br />Then in the input of WanT, you should indicate the name of the wavefunction as prefix= 'o_DS1'<br /><br />An example is in:<br />[want]/tests/test03<br /><br />Look for the files named as &quot;_abi&quot;</div>
