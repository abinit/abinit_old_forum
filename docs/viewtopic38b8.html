				<h3>Calculation for ground state of Cu crashes</h3>

				<div class="content">I hope this is the correct sub-forum to post this.<br /><br />I have been trying to replicate some of the results from some of the tutorials with Aluminum substituted by Copper. Currently I am stuck on the equivalent of the 4th tutorial.<br /><br />I downloaded the 29-Cu.LDA.fhi and 29cu.pspnc pseudopotentials listed on PSEUDOPOTENTIALS link in the ABINIT site, and I modified the input file from the 4th tutorial appropriately.<br /><br />However, for both of these I am getting some crashes in the calculation that seem to depend on the value of ECUT used --- in a rather unpredictable way, since some values converge while others do not. I am including a FILES file, an input file, and the log and most recent output file. The result is for the 29cu.pspnc pseudopotential file, but I must stress that I am also getting crashes using the 29-Cu.LDA.fhi pseudopotential.<br /><br />(Do note that the attachment with the aforementioned files is a ZIP file, but I could not get it to attach until I changed the extension to .in --- please remove the extension so it is simply a .zip if that is a problem...)<br /><br />I would really appreciate any help. Thank you.<br /><br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />Well, the log file tells you what happened and what to do:<br /><br />  Action : if the cell size and shape are fixed (optcell==0),<br />   exchange two of the input rprim vectors;<br />   if you are optimizing the cell size and shape (optcell/=0),<br />   maybe the move was too large, and you might try to decrease strprecon.<br /><br /><br />So, try to decrease strprecon first.<br /><br />Igor</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you, I will see and try about your suggestion --- and sorry, the end of semester has come up, so I have a lot of work to do, and I hadn't had a chance to look for any replies.</div>
