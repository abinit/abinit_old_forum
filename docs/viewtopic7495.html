				<div class="content">The density has been generated with a new version of abinit (&gt; 5.7, hence the code) but you are using an old version of cut3d (5.3), which does not accept the new format.<br /><br />Use a more recent version of cut3d, which should be present alongside your abinit executable, and remove the old cut3d.<br /><br />Try &quot;which cut3d&quot; to see which version of cut3d is actually being used on the command line.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Use the same distro for the abinit and cut3d executables. They should be in src/98_main/, or in the bin directory you chose if you ran &quot;make install&quot;. Obviously cut3d can not be &quot;forward compatible&quot; with abinit versions in the future...<br /><br />M.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br />I also have the same problem to use cut3d.<br />The version is 6.4.3 abinit static binaries and I put 'abinit' and 'cut3d' in the same directory. (&quot;tutorial/Input/Work&quot;).<br />Before I use 6.4.3, I tried to insatll 6.6.1 but I cannot succeed. That's why I go back to 6.4.3.<br />I run apt-get install abinit first before running cut3d.<br />I am not sure if it is the version problem.<br />Could anyone help me solve this problem ?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

				<div class="content">If you install the correct version, and the problem is still there. Try to add the cut3d 's detail path before executing it. Maybe it works.</div>
