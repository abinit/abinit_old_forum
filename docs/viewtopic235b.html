				<div class="content">3 years ago, I did a GW calculations for 24 atom system, I first did it in Abinit and it took me more than <strong class="text-strong">8 hours unfinished GW calculation</strong>. (I think its taking huge time in solving the Self Energy Sigma?) My supervisors advised me to use VASP since that is what was installed in the Lab, I am the only one insisting to use Abinit, while the rest were using VASP. Vasp was donated to the Lab so I guess that is why they Insisted that we make use of it.  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br /><br />So I did my study in VASP and it just took me <strong class="text-strong">two hours done</strong>. As I recall, in Abinit I can adjust the energy bands at which GW will be calculated, In VASP all energy bands is calculated in GW but still VASP is faster!?  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_surprised.gif" alt=":o" title="Surprised" /> <br /><br />Now I am in a different Lab and I am configuring a new system much powerful than my previous Lab, and I am going to use Abinit, Yey!  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />This time, I want to be able to get rid of the things that is making my GW calculations slow, but I dont know how?<br /><br />Things that speed things up in GW VASP<br /><br />1. Lower the GW cut off energy<br /><br />I did the same thing in Abinit before but nothing could make it comparable to the VASP speed, so I am completely clueless! Anybody could please help?<br /><br />If its important, <br /><br />1. Abinit is on MPI and ground state calculation was fast, comparable to VASP<br />2. Both were using Atlas linear algebra</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Dominic, <br /><br />In order to gain speed when using abinit, you have to compile it with mpiifort compiler and mkl libraries.<br /><br />Furthermore, it could be possible that VASP has a better symmetry detection, and hence only for a smaller number of k points QP energies are calculated.<br /><br />If you are interested in fast G0W0 + BSE calculations, i recommend you YAMBO.<br /><br /><br />Bests<br />LUCA</div>
