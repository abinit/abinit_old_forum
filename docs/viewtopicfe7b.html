				<div class="content">Dear abinit users,<br /><br />I would like to calculate the complete band structure using hybrid functionals (HSE, PBE0), is this possible in v8.0.8? Can anyone provide a help on the general procedure to follow? That will be much appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Hazem</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Eric, <br /><br />Thank you for your kind reply.<br /><br />I would like to know on how to technically apply that in band structure calculations.<br /><br />In the test v7 #t65, one dataset is for a usual SCF run and then a second dataset with ixc = 41 (PBE0), this works fine and gives the total energy. <br />When I add a third dataset to calculate the band structure (with k-points paths) and getden -1 it gives the DFT band structure from dataset 1, which is not the desired result.<br /><br />For HSE, I tried just setting ixc=-524 (via libXC) with the two datasets usually needed for BS calculations, the run completes, but I am not sure about the band gap, it does not seem to be corrected as expected. I will need to do better tests.<br /><br />Does one need to do the calculations it with the gwcalctyp=105/205 (HSE06) or 205/225 (PBE0)? and then for the BS one will probably need to interpolate it using Wannier functions?<br /><br />Thanks again and best regards,<br />Hazem</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Hazem,<br /><br />For the time being, it is not possible to restart a non-self-consistent calculation with Hybrid functional (Fock) from a density file. It make sense because Fock operator depends directly on the WF.<br />In a future realease of Abinit, it will (for sure) be possible to restart from the WF.<br />Meanwhile, to plot a band structure, your only possibility it to compute manually each k-point (have a whole set of key-points containing the ones you want to plot).<br /><br />Regards,</div>
