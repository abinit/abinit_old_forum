				<h3>PostDoc in energetic materials (Paris,France)</h3>

				<div class="content"><strong class="text-strong">Study of energetic materials by first-principles methods. Theoretical development and applications.</strong><br /><br />A postdoctoral position is available in France, at the &quot;Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique&quot; (CEA,<br />Bruyères le Châtel, south of Paris, France).<br />We are interested here in the properties of energetic materials based on molecular solids. The<br />goal is to determine their structural and thermodynamic properties (equation of state) using<br />first-principles methods, based on electronic properties, such as Density-Functional Theory (DFT).<br />In this type of materials, long range van der Waals interactions play a preponderant role. As they are<br />not correctly modeled by the Standard Density-Functional Theory, it is necessary to go beyond the<br />usual approximations [1].<br /><br />Moreover, the materials of interest are molecular solids based on organic molecules. Therefore they<br />contain a large number of hydrogen atoms whose nuclei are known to have a quantum behavior (zero<br />point energy).<br /><br />In this project, we propose to use a non-local van der Waals functional in the following framework:<br />1) The <strong class="text-strong">ABINIT</strong> software [2] will be used developed as part of an high visibility international project,<br />and especially in our group. ABINIT is computational software in the DFT formalism, using a plane<br />wave basis. It has recently been adapted to many-core computer architectures (e.g. Intel MIC).<br />2) The <strong class="text-strong">non-local van der Waals functional</strong> will be implemented in the complete <strong class="text-strong">&quot;Projector<br />Augmented-Wave&quot;</strong> (PAW) formalism, which allows obtaining results with a high precision. To date,<br />there is no code implementing a complete &quot;PAW + van der Waals&quot; formalism.<br />3) The calculation of van der Waals forces will be coupled with the <strong class="text-strong">&quot;Path-Integral Molecular<br />Dynamics&quot;</strong> method, in order to take into account both long-range interactions and the quantum<br />effect of hydrogen nuclei. To our knowledge, this has not yet been achieved on the materials<br />studied here.<br /><br />The applicant will first have to develop the theoretical framework (complete non-local functional in<br />the PAW formalism); then implement it in the ABINIT code, with particular attention paid to<br />parallelism on many-core architecture. Finally the code will be used for the targeted applications<br />(properties of the molecular solids).<br /><br />The CEA is a leading national center for numerical simulations and has also access to multiple<br />computational resources in several HPC centers.<br /><br /><em class="text-italics">Requisites</em>:<br />The candidate should have obtained a <strong class="text-strong">PhD in computational/theoretical physics</strong> for less than two<br />years; they should have an interest in the use of <strong class="text-strong">electronic structure methods</strong> to solve challenging<br />condensed matter problems and a solid background in solid state physics.<br /><strong class="text-strong">Experience in development</strong> and good knowledge of computing language(s) (Fortran, C) is a<br />prerequisite. A parallel programming experience is welcome.<br />The postdoctoral position is available for one year, renewable upon mutual agreement.<br />Because of restrictions due to European supercomputers access we are looking for candidate<br />nationals from Europe or north-America.<br /><br />If you are interested and motivated by this project, please send a detailed CV and a letter of<br />application to Jordan Bieder (Jordan DOT Bieder AT cea.fr) and Marc Torrent (marc DOT torrent AT<br />cea.fr), CEA, Bruyères-le-Chatel, 91297 Arpajon - France<br /><br />[1] Dion et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)<br />[2] <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/">www.abinit.org</a><!-- w --><br />[3] Torrent et al., Comp. Mat. Sc. 42, 337 (2008)</div>
