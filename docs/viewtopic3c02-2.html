				<div class="content">Hi guys bit of a rookie question here but im pretty stuck...<br />I'm working with v6.8.1 of ABINIT, and have succesfully ran './configure' and 'make' (at least so far as I can tell) with MPI enabled.  I have begun running the tests (run-basic-tests.sh - located in the directory abinit-6.8.1/tests/Scripts) and they have been succesful.  However I cant actually find the executable 'abinip' anywhere!  The test scripts are constantly saying things like 'starting abinit' so I assume that they are there somewhere.  If anybody could point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated.  Many Thanks<br />Jack M</div>

				<div class="content">Ahha slight improvement ive found the 'abinit' executable, however from using previous versions (v5.8 I think) I was expecting a serial version and a seperate parallel version (abinis and abinip resp.) is this no longer the case?  Jack M</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />Abinit executable are located in the /src/98_main directory.<br /><br />And you are right, there is no longer a distinction between serial and parallel versions of abinit.</div>
