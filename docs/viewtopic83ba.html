				<h3>3 PhD and 1 postdoctoral positions related to ABINIT</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Wed Apr 10, 2019 4:43 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>gonze</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Three PhD positions and one Postdoc position are available to work with Prof. Xavier Gonze (faculty.skoltech.ru/people/xaviergonze) at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.skoltech.ru/en/about/">www.skoltech.ru/en/about/</a><!-- w -->) in Moscow, Russia. The knowledge of English is required, knowledge of Russian is NOT a requirement. PhD positions start on November 1, 2019, postdoc might start in summer or later. Internships might be available as well in summer 2019.<br /><br />The group of Prof. Gonze develops and applies first-principles computational approaches for the study of high-technology materials, especially energy oriented ones. The research will focus on the effects of electron-vibration interaction: supraconductivity (e.g. under high-pressure), carrier mobility, polaron formation, thermoelectricity, photoluminescence ... and will involve computer developments in the frame of the international ABINIT project (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/">www.abinit.org</a><!-- w -->).  Prof. Gonze has a very large network of international collaborators either contributing to ABINIT or within the European Theoretical Spectroscopy facility (<!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.etsf.eu/">www.etsf.eu</a><!-- w -->). Synergies with other Skoltech faculty members as well as with the Gonze group at UCLouvain, Belgium (perso.uclouvain.be/xavier.gonze) are expected.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY (PhDs):<br />Candidates should hold (or be about to receive) a masterâ€™s degree in Physics, Materials Science, or a related area. Good knowledge of quantum mechanics is expected. Candidates who have interest in writing computer code are preferred. Please apply to Skoltech Materials Science and Engineering PhD program, <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.skoltech.ru/en/apply/phd-programs">www.skoltech.ru/en/apply/phd-programs</a><!-- w -->, before 21 April 2019, and also send your CV (pdf) as well as a brief motivation letter to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:X.Gonze@skoltech.ru">X.Gonze@skoltech.ru</a><!-- e -->. PhDs will also have an additional promotor from the Center of Energy Science and Technology crei.skoltech.ru/cest/people.<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY (Postdoc):<br />The postdoctoral position is a one-year contract, renewable upon availability of funds. Applicants should send their CV (pdf) as well as a brief motivation letter and a brief description of their coding skills and scientific achievements, to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:X.gonze@skoltech.ru">X.gonze@skoltech.ru</a><!-- e --> before 15 May 2019. They should also arrange for two letters of recommendation to be sent to the same address.<br /><br />Skoltech provides internationally competitive conditions, excellent salaries and medical insurance, and state of the art research conditions and environment.</div>
