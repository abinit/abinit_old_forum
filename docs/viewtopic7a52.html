				<div class="content">Hi,<br />I want to optimize the supercell organization and only relax the surface atoms.

Can someone tell me where is wrong? <br />Thanks~</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I see two problems in your input file. The first one is related to the paw overlap error. You give coordinates of the atoms with xcart but it seems that its reduced coordinates (am I right ?). So instead of xcart (positions of atoms in cartesian coordinates), you should use xred (positions of atoms in reduced coordinates with respect to unit cell vectors). The second problem is your fixing error. What abinit is telling you is that atoms 1 and 2 are equivalent by symmetry (this does NOT mean that they are in the same place !). Indeed you the z=0.11185 plane which is a mirror plane so these two atoms should be moved together (and they will, even if you use chksymbreak 0, because by symmetry, their forces will be the same). Also, for a surface, you might need more layers.<br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">Dear David,<br />Firstly, you are right, the positions of atoms are in reduced coordinates and it is my mistake. And I have modified it to xangst .<br />For the second error, I use 5 layers as a surface instead of  the previous 3 layers.  And the system is symmetric still. If I want to <br />relax the surface atoms and fix the others in the symmetric system, what should I set ? Thanks~</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Well increasing the number of layers will not change the symmetry of your system but in fact you have 2 surfaces and not just one and each surface is symmetry to the other one in your case (remember you are using periodic boundary conditions ...). So what you can do is fix the intern layers while letting the surface atoms relax. For your 3 layers example, this would be :<br /><br />natfix 3<br />iatfix 3 4 5<br /><br />If you really want to fix only one surface (but this might be more difficult to analyse though ... because even if you fix one of them, you still have a surface !), I think that setting the variable nsym to 1 will do the job (and moving very slightly your atoms so that they are not any more in a symmetric position), but I do not recommend you this option.<br /><br />David</div>
