				<div class="content">Hello all,<br /><br />During some recent calculations I found instances where the bug, and the resulting comments, needed clarification or are incorrect and wanted to point them out for the benefit of others.<br /><br />For example, while using fully-relativistic pseudo-potentials I received an error message that read <br />--- !ERROR<br />message: |<br />    Pseudopotential input file requires linear radial mesh<br />    starting at zero.<br />    Action : check your pseudopotential input file.<br />src_file: Subroutine Unknown<br />src_line: 0<br />...<br /><br />However, the real error in the calculation was not the pseudopotential file, but was an incorrectly set input variable nspinor.  If possible, it would be nice to catch this error when Abinit reads in the pseudopotential file by comparing the value of nspinor and the extension switch.  If they are the same then no error is given, if they are different then the program should break and the appropriate error message printed. <br /><br />Additionally, during a phonon calculation the following error message occurred during a response function calculation.<br /> --- !ERROR<br />src_file: Subroutine Unknown<br />src_line: 0<br />message: |<br />    error in mvrecord<br />...<br />This error occurs when the wave functions of the previous steps in the response function calculations are not fully converged.  Would it be possible to make the non-convergence of the wave function in a response function calculation an error warning? Since, if the wave function is not converged, then the results of the later steps in the calculation will necessarily contain errors.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>
