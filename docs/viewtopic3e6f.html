				<div class="content">Please install MPI (e.g. OpenMPI or MPICH) first, and then use the --with-mpi-prefix=/path/to/mpi/installation to tell the build system where MPI is. If you installed it through a package manager, usually --with-mpi-prefix=/usr will do.<br /><br />For more information, please see the forum rules above which contain a link to a tutorial video.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Sir,<br />My system had crashed when I Was trying to enable GPU support for ABINIT.. I installed a wrong driver. Now I have started afresh and installing ABINIT 7.6.1. Please find the config.log file and also the MAKE ERROR file. Sir, as per your guidance I successfully passed over the configuration, BUT now facing problems with MAKE.. <br />The following error creeps in:<br /><br /> required = MPI_THREAD_SINGLE<br />                             1<br />Error: Symbol 'mpi_thread_single' at (1) has no IMPLICIT type<br />make[3]: *** [m_xmpi.o] Error 1<br />make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/lib/abinit-7.6.1/src/12_hide_mpi'<br />make[2]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br />make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/lib/abinit-7.6.1/src'<br />make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1<br />make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/lib/abinit-7.6.1'<br />make: *** [all] Error 2<br /><br />Sir, I used the following configure command:<br />./configure --enable-mpi --enable-openmp --enable-mpi-fft --enable-mpi-io --enable-mpi-trace --with-mpi-prefix=/usr/lib/mpich<br /><br />I hve installed all &quot;OPENMPI&quot;, MPICH and MPICH2 through synaptic... I am unsure about openmpi version. I tried first with openmpi, but it gave some problems and so I moved onto MPICH. It worked/configured ABINIT very well. But during make gave me the above error.<br />Sir I have a i3 processor with 2.2 GHz, 2GB RAM, 500GB HDD, with 32 bit Linux mint 15. Can I enable 64 bit support on my 32 bit OS? Will it boost the computation speeds keeping in mind my laptop configuration?  Also can I find I-V characteristics of a electrode-sample-electrode system using ABINTI 7.6.1? Sorry for asking this question here. <br />Thanks in advance.</div>

				<div class="content">A 64-bit system is interesting only if you have 4Gb or more of memory. In your case, a 32-bit system is thus fairly enough and is probably not the cause of your problem. Regarding the error you get at build time, the config.log did not give me any useful information to pinpoint the origin. You could retry without the --enable-openmp option, in order to see whether this is a MPI-specific issue or a problem in mixing different kinds of parallelism.<br /><br />As far as GPU is concerned, the current implementation is limited to nVidia cards with Cuda, and is meant for developers with some experience in GPU debugging. In any case, even if you manage to have it working, you will probably not see a big difference over OpenMP / MPI.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Pouillon Sir,<br />I apologize for asking same question in two threads. Regarding my question, I am happy to inform you that I have succeeded in compiling the ABINIT-7.6.1 parallel build. <br />The problem seemed to be with the MPICH, OPENMPI installed using the Synaptic manager. I could not get them working. So I finally downloaded the source code of MPICH-3.0.4 from internet and compiled it myself. Then the ABINIT installed very well. Only one trick I did here was that I copied the mpi compiler files to a self made folder &quot;bin&quot; inside /usr/lib/mpich-3.0.4. Then the compilation finished successfully.<br />I would be gratful if you could provide me a PDF file to ABINIT commands or the full manual.</div>
