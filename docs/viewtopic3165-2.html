				<div class="content">I have been going through tutorespn tutorials and simply trying to compute frequencies at Gamma point of b-SiC. If anyone has done it successfully could you please share the wisdom. RF2 tutorial fails to produce the out file with frequencies and it is too complicated. I get lost in changing the variables and still not getting flawless calculations. <br /><br />Thank you! <br /><br />N</div>

				<div class="content">Dear nbod,<br /><br />it is very hard to guess where the problem is, without your input and output files. You should at least attach them. <br /><br />Also, you could put an effort to read through the rest of the forum. I think there are many similar (solved) problem there. If you don't find any, you could search through the old mailing list (available on the abinit web site). I'm almost certain that you'll find your answers there.<br />Furthermore, if you lack some theory, please, regard first the references mentioned in the RF tutorial. And read the netiquette.<br /><br />I hope that this will set you up on the right path.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Igor L.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Igor, thank you for your reply. Since then i have been able get phonon dispersion curve for b-SiC. Now I am trying some other structures - cryt-SiO2.

				<div class="content">Dear nbod,<br /><br />yes, you should change your trf2_1.in file. Heh, but the important stuff is in the first 3 datasets, which you haven't pasted into your post. Specifically, the list of q-points to be used in the rf calculation. There are really a lot of posts here on the forum about the same problem. Here's one, for example<br /><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic4c2a.html?f=10&amp;t=1220">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=1220</a><!-- l --><br /><br />On the other hand, did you go through the tutorial? Check the trf2_2.in.<br /><br />Igor</div>
