				<div class="content">Dear Eric and ABINIT friends,<br /><br />It is not only strange, it does not make sense. Since even the default value of pawovlp = 5, which enables an overlap of at least 5%, was not passed. So even if the code would neglect the input, then the default value should be applicable. Though I already reported an issue about the default value of pawovlp.<br /><br />So, to my opinion, something is wrong in the code. Hence my request of filing a bug report.<br /><br />If pawovlp = 6 does not work. Why should I expect that setting pawvolp = 10 will work? The overlap ratio was 4.94%, which is clearly less than 10%, 6%, and even 5%.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Willem,<br />Yes, sounds there is a small bug here, my proposition was to allow you to run your calculation, not as a fix of the bug <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> We'll look at that internally with the dev. Thanks for reporting it.<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Eric and ABINIT friends,<br /><br />I like your idea with setting pawovlp to a large value at the start of the investigations and the decrease the value to zero at the end. At least close to zero, when the system and parameters are used to calculate physical/chemical properties. It makes sense and fits into a total workflow.<br /><br />That said, it is important that the parameter setting of pawovlp will be honoured by ABINIT. This is not always the case and I hope/believe that developers will have a close look to my reports about this issue.<br /><br />For a beginner, it is best to get a stop instead of a warning. The learning effect is more efficient when the frustration is large <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. I'm a chemist by training and I do remember my time in the lab. <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />:)<br /><br />And indeed you were right that the error message, related to pawovlp, can be an indication of some other error: Another Nudged Elastic Band calculation (not the initial one of this thread) stopped because of the mentioned error. It appeared that the atoms in the initial and final state were not correctly aligned. They were correctly mapped, but due to the boundary conditions, the coordinates of the atoms did not fit in all cases. I had to manually adjust.<br /><br />Thank you for your response, it is really helpful.</div>
