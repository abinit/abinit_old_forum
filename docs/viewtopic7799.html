				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />Is it possible to get the contributions to the energy bands from each atoms with norm-conserving pp? Just like the fatbands in PAW. From the manual, fatbands are not support by ncpp. However, is there another way to get the information?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Xiaoming Wang<br />Postdoc<br />Rutgers</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />You can do it yourself using Xmgrace, for example. You just plot the contribution as errors represented as symbol sizes.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Igor</div>

In fact, I'm not concerning the plot of the fatbands, but how to get the contribution data of each atom for the NCPP.<br /><br />Best,<br />Xiaoming</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if there is a variable which will 'directly' give you the atom species decomposed DOS. Some of the 'elders' probably know better. I do it by using prtdos 3 to obtain the l decomposed DOS for each atom. Then I add all the l contribution for each atom and get what you asked for. Expect 'errors' here, however, since you are not using PAW datasets (read prtdos 3 description).<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Igor</div>

In QuantumEspresso, for projected dos calculation, it will output the contribution or the weight of each angular momentum l for each k point and each band. Would that be possible in ABINIT? Actually, I need the k point resolved DOS (in fact the fatbands), which sounds weird but the DOS is the summation over all the k points. So I think ABINIT also has that information.<br /><br />Best,<br />Xiaoming</div>
