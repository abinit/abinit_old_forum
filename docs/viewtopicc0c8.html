				<div class="content">Dear abiniters,<br /><br />It is with great pleasure that we invite you to attend the “Inaugural Symposium of the &quot;Computational Materials Scholars Program of Excellence&quot;” at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech), Russia, on September 4-6, 2019. The conference will be followed by the hands-on training: Computational Materials Discovery School on September 7-8, 2019 (Saturday and Sunday), that includes a half-day training for ABINIT on Saturday 7 September morning.<br /><br />Both events will be held at Skoltec​h’s new campus. See the program with our international list of speakers at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://cmp.skoltech.ru/program/">https://cmp.skoltech.ru/program/</a><!-- m --> . <br />We encourage the participation of students and postdocs in the form of posters (registration is free). Please inform people in your group/department/community about this opportunity.<br /><br />The abstract submission deadline is July 15th , 2019. Conference registration deadline is July 22th, 2019 (cmp.skoltech.ru/cart).<br /><br />We envision our interdisciplinary conference as an open forum for active interactions between researchers from different subfields. The scope of the conference is a variety of modern modeling approaches simulating structure, electronic properties, non-equilibrium dynamics and transport in technologically important materials and bio-systems, which complement and guide experiments. <br /><br />Computational Materials Discovery School provides detailed hands-on training on leading computational codes, such as Abinit, Fhi-Aims, AMULTET, and USPEX, which will be given by their developers (many of whom are based at Skoltech). We will also provide a crash course on popular codes VASP, Gaussian, MOPAC, and LAMMPS, together with toolboxes MolMod and SIMAN.<br /><br />Administrative support via <!-- e --><a href="mailto:cmp@skoltech.ru">cmp@skoltech.ru</a><!-- e -->.<br /><br />We look forward to your contribution and participation in the conference.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Artem R. Oganov and Sergei Tretiak,<br /><br />Conference Organizers</div>
