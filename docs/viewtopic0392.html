				<div class="content">Hi,<br />I am new in abinit. Last few days, i was struggling to run L12 structure, but i couldn't run it. Even i didn't find any input file for L12, L10 such common structure input file, What i have found Wurtzite structure. But it would be nice to put some common structure input file in the test. I agreed that hundreds of input file in the test but all are same kind of input file. In the following, i have put my L12 structure input file,<br /><br /># Crystalline AlSc : computation of the total energy<br />#<br /><br />#Specific to ground state calculation<br />  tolvrs   1.0d-18      # SCF stopping criterion<br />    iscf   5            # Self-consistent calculation, using algorithm 5<br /><br /><br />#######################################################################<br />#Common input variables<br /><br />#Definition of the unit cell<br />acell 3*7.7534         # This is equivalent to   10.61 10.61 10.61<br />rprim  1.0  0.0  0.0   # In lessons 1 and 2, these primitive vectors <br />       0.0  1.0  0.0   # (to be scaled by acell) were 1 0 0  0 1 0  0 0 1 <br />       0.0  0.0  1.0   # that is, the default.<br /><br />#Definition of the atom types<br />ntypat 2               # There are two types of atom<br />znucl 13 21            # The keyword &quot;znucl&quot; refers to the atomic number of the <br />                       # possible type(s) of atom.

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />It would be helpful to have the error message... Is it normal that you have 3 Al atoms and only one As atom?<br /><br />Please provide with more information about your problem.<br /><br />Boris</div>
