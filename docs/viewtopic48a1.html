				<h3>Structural optimization of CrO2Cl2</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi folks!<br /><br />Using ABINIT, I was trying to find the optimized geometry of the CrO2Cl2 molecule. I found some old literature values (somewhere from the 70s) that I used as a starting point. After convergence testing (i.e. energy cutoff and cell size), I first tried using the BFGS scheme (ionmov 2) for the optimization. But after the results did give any clues (moving of positions mostly happened in one direction only), I started the same calculations, only this time with MD+Verlet scheme (ionmov 6), but here, no actual ion movement occurs.<br /><br />I have uploaded the input files and the corresponding results so you can have a look at them. (Dataset 1 was the literature given geometry, 2-4 are modifications of this by changing the bond angles. Actually, some forces should occur driving the constituents apart into the positions of dataset 1 assuming this is the minimal energy configuration.)<br /><br />Is it possibly necessary to state the degrees of freedom or disable symmetry calculations?<br /><br />Thank you very much for your help!<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Oliver<br /><br />P.S.: bfgs.out was too large to attach (~450KB), but I can mail it if someone wants to have a look at it</div>

				<div class="content">P.S.:<br />It seems adding<br /><br />nsym 1<br />chkprim 0<br /><br />to the input file solved the problem. The coordinates are now moving freely.<br /><br />Just wanted to give some update,<br />Oliver</div>

				<div class="content">ok, well if it's working great - nsym 1 probably made some forces small but /= 0 and that started the motion. Note that ionmov 6 is MD, not relaxation, since there is no friction term. Is there a specific reason you're not happy with BFGS? It is usually the most efficient.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Matthieu,<br /><br />thank you for the hint. I just saw, that ionmov 1 should be relaxation with some friction. Nope, the only reason to go away from BFGS was, that I was not sure, whether my problems were related to it. After adding the options I mentioned before, the Broyden scheme also works as I expected.<br /><br />Thank you and<br />best regards<br /><br />Oliver</div>
