				<h3>Running Tutorials in Ubuntu</h3>

				<div class="content">Hey all,<br />I have successfully installed Abinit-6.4.1 on my machine, running Ubuntu. Everything seems to be fine, the tests all seem to run fine but then when I try to complete the tutorials, it's as if the code isn't doing anything. I use abinit &lt;t1x.files&gt;&amp; log and a log file is produced in my &quot;work&quot; directory, but no other output files are produced. According the tutorial I should see: t11.out t1xo_DDB  t1xo_DEN  t1xo_EIG  t1xo_WFK, in addition to the pre-existing t1x.files and t11.in. None of these other output files are being produced. I would like to learn the code so I can run more complicated simulations on it. Ideas?<br />L</div>

				<div class="content">What's in the log file? Are you sure that the .files file is pointing to the pseudopotential directory correctly? If you copied it from the test tree to a work directory, it won't be correct--it will still point to the Psps_for_tests directory relative to its original location, and you will have to adjust this.</div>

				<div class="content">sometimes nothing will be printed to log if the buffering of your shell is too long. Try running without re-directing output, and see what abinit complains about.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

It looks like tutorials are properly installed, and they are located in <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>/usr/share/doc/abinit-doc/tutorials/</code></pre></div>. In my earliest opportunity, I will try to reproduce the problem that you experienced, and post the result here.</div>
