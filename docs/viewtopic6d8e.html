				<h3>Too Many q Points in GKK files?</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear All:<br /><br />I am calculating electron-phonon properties. The unit cell contains 5 atoms, with k-mesh 8x8x8, and q mesh 2x2x2. There are 8 in-equivalent q points. This leads to a 5x3x8=120 perturbations in MRGGKK input, and 8 DDB files in MRGDDB input.<br /><br />the mrgddb and mrggkk seems both OK. However, when running anaddb, it says:<br /><br />read_gkk.F90:302:ERROR<br />found too many qpoints in GKK file wrt anaddb input<br />nqpt_anaddb nqpt_gkk = 6 7<br /><br /><br />I have no single clue that what might be going on, that where the number &quot;6&quot; and &quot;7&quot; come from. Any suggestions? Many thanks!!!<br /><br />Best,<br /><br /><br />ps: Due to the too many problem I've met, I am serious thinking of co-authorship if we could conquer these difficulties together. Looking for help sincerely.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Please read the nettiquette - it gets really hard to guess what is going on.<br /><br />For 8 inequivalent q from a 2x2x2 grid that means you have no symmetries at all?<br /><br />The values read_gkk is complaining about are <br />1) the number it has calculated from your ngqpt and shifts<br />2) the number it reads from your main GKK file<br /><br />the two should agree of course, and it looks like it has found some symmetries, but without any log or output or input or anything it's a bit hard to tell.<br /><br />Also check that your GKK files are merged grouped together by qpt.<br /><br />Finally you might try the latest abinit/anaddb version. From 7.6.4 there is a new procedure to calculate the matrix elements separately, on a k-point grid of your choosing (check the doc and tutorials). You may have to be careful to specify the Fermi level explicitly with elph_fermie if you use this non self-consistent scheme.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
