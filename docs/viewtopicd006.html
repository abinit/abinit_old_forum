				<div class="content">Hai<br /><br />I would like to know the system requirements for running abinit on my PC. <br /><br />When I tried to run ground state calculations with nearly 32 atoms on my laptop with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor having 4GB RAM, the calculations are taking longer duration to complete and the system is getting stuck in the meantime. I am not sure of whether the long duration of run is due to insufficient hardware availability.<br />I wish to know by buying a high-end laptop, Can I do the calculations much faster?<br />If anyone knows about this, please reply.<br /><br /><br />Thanks and Regards<br />Seba</div>

				<div class="content">First, the output file will contain a section at the top with an estimate of how  much memory the calculation should take. Look for the line that begins &quot;P This job should need less than...&quot; Secondly, in my experience, 32 atoms would be a huge calculation to attempt to run on a laptop. In my work I would be running such a system on a few dozen cores on a cluster. Buying a better laptop will of course run things faster but no laptop in the world will cope effectively with tens of atoms in a DFT calculation. To do systems this big you will really need to get access to some kind of multi-core machine.</div>
