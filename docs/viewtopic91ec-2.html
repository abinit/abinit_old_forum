				<h3>Reducing memory needs</h3>

				<div class="author">by <strong>ruslan</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello, abinit users!<br /><br />I am trying to calculate phonons using PAW formalism and abinit. Because it is not implemented [yet] i am falling back to phonopy code <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/">http://phonopy.sourceforge.net/</a><!-- m --> . The methodics is relatively straight-forward, program generates supercells with distorted atom positions and takes calculated forces as input to produce phonot spectra. <br /><br />My problem arises when i am trying to simulate 3x3x3 supercell with 8 atoms in each unit cell. This results in roughly 1440 bands and i was unable to bring such a system to running due to out-of-memory errors. How can one reduce memory demands of simulation? The things i tried:<br /><ul><li> Just increasing number of processors does not help because the total number of k-points with ngkpt=4x4x4 is 16 and most of processors are idle. </li><li> Activation of paral_kgb option. Apart from standard settings wfoptalg 4, nloalg 4, fftalg 401, intxc 0 and fft_opt_lob 2 i tried enabling parallelization over k-points (npkpt  16, npband 2, npfft 1, bandpp 1). I tried various combinations of options, but i am missing some hint like &quot;the memory used by each processor gets divided by npband (npfft or something else)&quot;. Is at all possible to reduce memory by parallelization?</li><li> Activating mkmem=0. Some data gets written to disc, but i am unsure whether the simulation gets slower (can one provide a rough estimate of slowdown factor?) The problem in this case is, that i cannot use band/fft parallelization and the simulation lasts for ages.</li></ul><br />I am using a Cray XT6 machine with 24 processors and 32 GB/node. I tried reducing number of MPI tasks per node with little success. With 3 MPI tasks/node i could start the simulation, but this seem to be a very inefficient mode of operating parallel machine.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ruslan Zinetullin</div>

In most cases as you displace atoms you will break symmetry and use all of the k-points (of course nkpt will change for each displacement case...)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div></li><li> Activation of paral_kgb option.

Parllelizing over g vectors is even more efficient in reducing memory, but it can be much worse for parallel scaling if you have a slow network (ethernet)<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div></li><li> Activating mkmem=0.

The factor will depend on your disk i/o so there is no rule (some systems are fine with this mode). And indeed there are a number of options you can't use with mkmem 0 - there is no guarantee all processors will have access to the scratch file, and some combinations are just not coded.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><br />I am using a Cray XT6 machine with 24 processors and 32 GB/node.

In most cases as you displace atoms you will break symmetry and use all of the k-points (of course nkpt will change for each displacement case...)<br /></div></blockquote><br />let's consider following example: 3x3x3 supercell of Nb3Sn. First, i tried to make a run with ideal atomic positions, an load this WF into perturbed simulations to ease convergence. I have following setup:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>acell 29.6035314709658941 29.6035314709658941 29.6035314709658941<br />ntypat 2<br />znucl 41 50<br />natom 216<br />typat 162*1 54*2<br />nband 1440<br /><br />ecut 20<br />pawecutdg 20<br />kptopt 1<br />ngkpt 4 4 4<br /><br />paral_kgb 1<br />wfoptalg 4<br />nloalg=4<br />fftalg=401<br />intxc=0<br />fft_opt_lob=2<br /><br />npkpt 4<br />npband 12<br />npfft&nbsp; 2<br />bandpp&nbsp; 4<br /><br />prtposcar 1<br /><br />chkprim 0<br />maxnsym 1296 # supercell has more symmetries<br /><br />prtden 1<br />prtwf 1<br />prteig 0<br />tolvrs 1.0d-16<br />diemac 1000000<br />xred<br />... positions here<br /></code></pre></div><br />This case results in nkpt=4, which is fairly small. Memory needs seem to be within limits:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>P This job should need less than                    1057.967 Mbytes of memory.<br />  Rough estimation (10% accuracy) of disk space for files :<br />  WF disk file :    811.760 Mbytes ; DEN or POT disk file :      6.594 Mbytes.<br /><br /> Biggest array : pawfgrtab%gylm(gr), with    302.9008 MBytes.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />But my problem is, that i cannot run even such a simple system with 96 processors! log:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> ITER STEP NUMBER     1<br /> vtorho : nnsclo_now=  2, note that nnsclo,dbl_nnsclo,istep=  0 0  1<br /> starting lobpcg, with nblockbd,mpi_enreg%nproc_band          30          12<br />[NID 00040] 2010-10-13 01:01:40 Apid 23269: initiated application termination<br />[NID 00040] 2010-10-13 01:01:48 Apid 23269: OOM killer terminated this process.<br />Application 23269 exit signals: Killed<br />Application 23269 resources: utime 0, stime 0<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Each node has 32GB of memory, which seem enough for this job. I ran abinit with paral_kgb=-96 and got<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp; nproc&nbsp; &nbsp; npkpt&nbsp; &nbsp; npband&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;npfft&nbsp; &nbsp; bandpp&nbsp; &nbsp; weight<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 96&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.25<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 96&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.50<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 96&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;12&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.50<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; 96&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.00<br /></code></pre></div><br /><br />Obviously it makes no sence to increase npkpt, because there are only 4 k-points. Which parameter could be adjusted (if any) to run the simulation? I already reduced values of ecut/pawecutdg to rather small value of 20. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yes, search the forum for paral_kgb and check the web site and variable definitions. Parllelizing over g vectors is even more efficient in reducing memory, but it can be much worse for parallel scaling if you have a slow network (ethernet)<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />What do you mean by parallelizing over g-vectors? npkpt? As you can see i set maximal allowable value of npkpt and it does not really help. <br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Ruslan Zinetullin</div>
