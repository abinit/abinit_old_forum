				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I find at least with 7.6.2 that, using atompaw as a fallback, it gets compiled by make but then &quot;make install&quot; doesn't install it to the /opt/abinit... prefix I had set. Is there a different make target I should be using or is this an overlooked issue?<br /><br />thanks,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">AtomPAW in Abinit is only used for some tests when a new version of AtomPAW is released. If you intend to use it for production, the best is to build it separately.<br /><br />I'll look at the issue when I have some time, but it is possible that it has already been fixed in 7.7.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks, I had come to that conclusion, I think the documentation on the PAW generation page needs to be updated. I'll try to do that when I check some of the other tutorial pages for the upcoming Lyon school.<br /><br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Joe,<br /><br />I don't think the tutorial PAW2 has to be changed; the atompaw executable is clearly located (I was aware of this make install issue).<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>First, just try to type: atompaw<br />if &quot;atompaw vx.y.z&quot; message appears, everything is fine.<br />Otherwise, you can try &quot;~abinit_compilation_directory/fallbacks/exports/bin/atompaw-abinit&quot;<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Marc</div>
