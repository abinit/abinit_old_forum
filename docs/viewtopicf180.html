				<div class="content">The CECAM School on &quot;Response treatment for the dynamical properties of materials with the ABINIT package&quot; will take place from 22 to 26th of October, 2012 at the ETH, Zurich, Switzerland.<br /><br />This tutorial is aimed to young European students and postdocs interested in first-principle calculations of vibrational spectroscopies,  thermal properties, non-linear dynamical properties, couplings with strain, with electric field, with magnetic field ... With more than 1200 registered users, ABINIT is a well-established open software package for the first-principles calculations of the properties of solids. One of the strengths of the package is the straightforward computation and easy analysis of such various physical quantities using the linear and non-linear responses formalism. Applications will concern a wide variety of materials such as semiconductors, ferroelectrics, piezoelectrics and multiferroics, insulators, crystalline and disordered materials, nanostructures, Earth and planetary materials, etc. <br /><br />This tutorial will include two types of activities : (1) lectures on theory, algorithms and implementations in the morning sessions and (2) hands-on exercises in the afternoon sessions. From our previous experience, this type of tutorial typically attracts two kinds of students: some advanced students who already know the basic of Density-Functional Theory (DFT) and want to learn about linear and non-linear responses,  and some beginner students who need to acquire some basic background about DFT before going further in the response formalism. To make the tutorial attractive and highly beneficial to all students, we will  deal with 2 groups in parallel during the first two days, giving lectures on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) implementation to advanced students during the time beginners learn the basic of DFT and its implementation in ABINIT. Then, from the middle of the second day all students will follow the same lecture.<br /><br />For more information, and in order to apply for the school, please go to <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cecam.org/workshop-790.html">http://www.cecam.org/workshop-790.html</a><!-- m --><br />Deadline for registration : June 20.<br />Acceptance notification expected around July 10.<br />There will be no registration fee.<br />Although we intent to cover the major part of the local expenses for the students (housing and meals), confirmation of allocation<br />will only be done at the time of the notification of acceptance. Travel expenses for students will not be covered.</div>
