				<h3>Finding ground state with optical phonons</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,everyone!<br />There is a paragraph in a paper:<br />The search for the ground state was started with the determination of the structure for which frequencies of all optical phonons at the Γ point would be positive. Since in the phonon spectrum of the P4/mmm phase of all the investigated superlattices, there were unstable modes at the Γ point (with imaginary mode frequencies), <strong class="text-strong">small perturbations corresponding to the eigenvector of the least stable of these modes were introduced into the structure </strong>and the fequilibrium structure of the low symmetry phase was<br />determined by means of the relaxation of atomic positions and the unit cell parameters.<br /><br />So I calculate the dynamical matrix at Gamma point with BTO.in, then anaddb the DDB file with input file btogamma.in. I got some eigendisplacements corresponding to different modes, as in btogamma.out. Is the eigendisplacement the very perturbation to be introduced to the structure? If not, how can I realise the search described in the paper! Thank you!<br /><br />Input files are attached.</div>
