				<h3>Availability of vdW-DF1/2 functionals</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I am interested in performing some calculations on bulk gold using the van der Waals vdW-DF functionals. As far as I can tell these are not yet included in the current distribution, as setting vdw_xc=1,2 in my input parameters does not affect the calculation at all. Am I missing something about how to compile the code/set up the calculation? If not, would it be possible to acquire a version of the code with these experimental functionals to try out?<br /><br />Many thanks in advance for your help,<br /><br />Fabiano Corsetti<br />Imperial College London</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Fabiano,<br />I am having a similar problem. I am trying to include van der Waals interactions while simulating graphite. I found the pseusopotential that well extimates the 'c' side of the unit cell, but then when I add the input variable vdw_xc 1 (I've tryed as well with 2 using an other functional) nothing change, and i have the same result as before, as if I never added this variable. I am using now the 6.10.3 version of ABINIT, and i am wandering what is going wrong. <br />Thank you for you attention<br /><br />Valentina Dellac√†</div>

				<div class="content">I wanted to bump this up a bit, and ask in the friendliest of manners (since I'm neither developing nor paying for the code, being polite is the only thing I've got) if moving the vdW-DF1/2 functionals into the debugging stage with the new release means that they can be used, but need testing against known results?  As a cursory trial, it appears that simply changing vdw_xc to 1 or 2 still doesn't change the calculation, and the variables are still listed as developmental.  <br />Cheers,<br />James</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I am experiencing the same thing - setting vdw_xc to 1 or 2 has no effect on my calculations. I am using Abinit 7.10.4. Is there something wrong with how I compiled the code, or is this still a known issue?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Marie</div>

				<div class="content">Apparently this is still the case. Including df2 does absolutely nothing but print the variable out. I trusted abinit too much. At least an error should be printed if one tries to use an unimplemented feature.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Ron,<br />Camilo Espejo, who implemented the vdW in Abinit, has a technical problem to reply in the forum, so please find here his response:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi (recohen) Ron, <br />It's been our fault not to stop Abinit execution if vdw_xc=1,2. Currently if any of these values is set, Abinit will not actually call for the vdW-DF module. This issue will be corrected asap in the development version  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_redface.gif" alt=":oops:" title="Embarrassed" /> .  <br />Some bugs remain to be solved before we can make the implementation of vdW-DF publicly available, since the values of the vdW energy we are getting now are not fully reliable. I think this will take two more months.  I'll let you know when the fully operational implementation can be found in the development version.<br />Regards,<br />Camilo.<br /></div></blockquote></div>
