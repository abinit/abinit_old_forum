				<div class="content">Dear Abinit users<br /><br />I am very sad to say that for my last few posts in the forum, I didn't get any reply. <br />I am posting my problem now with a hope that someone will help me with some suggestions.<br /><br />I am trying to optimize water molecule on aluminium doped graphene. Even after 182 iteration steps, the self consistent field is not converging.<br />I have used toldff 5.0d-5, nstep as 200.<br /><br />Could someone tell me what could be the problem that leads to this non-convergence.<br /><br />Regards<br />Seba</div>

				<div class="content">Well, you probably have a difficult system. Did you do lots of control experiments? Did you make sure that your model of Al-doped graphene itself gives predictions that agree with expt or intuition? Did you make sure you can accurately model an H2O molecule on a simpler surface, say pure Al or pure graphene?</div>

That's why I tried using the same and with GGA, I am getting the warning message that &quot;nstep =200 was not enough SCF cycles to converge&quot;. <br /><br /> I was able to model Aluminium doped graphene alone using GGA of PBE, the results are close to previously reported theoretical results. But I am having convergence issues on optimizing the geometry of H2O on Al-doped graphene. Can you please suggest what could be possible reasons for this SCF convergence issue.<br /><br />Thanks in Advance<br />Seba</div>
