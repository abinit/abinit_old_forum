				<div class="content">Hello abinit users,<br />       I haved used abinit to calculate the graphene's superconducting properties. I have optimized the cell and ions, and my k-mesh:36*36*1,q-mesh:9*9*1,ecut:40 ha. However,in anaddb calculation,when I use  defaults of elphsmear(0.01 ha) and a2fsmear(2e-5 ha), in the outfile of phonon linewidth, there are some phonon linewidth values are negative. The values aren't all positive until elphsmear=0.2 ha. We know, in the function of phonon linewidth, it couldn't be negative. I don't know why. Can you help me ? The follow is anaddb inputfile:<br />elphflag 1<br />nqpath 4<br />qpath<br /> 0.0 0.0 0.0    # gamma<br /> 0.5 0.0 0.0    # M<br /> 1/3 1/3 0.0    # K<br /> 0.0 0.0 0.0    # gamma <br />     <br />ngqpt 9 9 1<br /><br />asr 2 <br />dipdip 0<br /><br />brav 1<br /><br />nqshft 1<br />q1shft 0.0 0.0 0.0<br />ifcflag 1<br />ifcana 1<br />natifc 2<br />atifc 1 2 <br />ifcout 3 <br />dieflag 0<br /><br />eivec 1<br /><br />symdynmat 0<br />elphsmear 0.01<br /><br />Thank you very much! Best wishes!</div>

				<div class="content">The negative value comes from the Fourier transform interpolation of the linewidths... they are unphysical I agree. They come from the rapid variation of the e-p linewidths with q, which is not smooth and sinusoidal (ie easily FT-able)<br /><br />You can try playing with ep_doscalprod - if you do the scalar product with the phonon displacement vectors before interpolation things behave a bit better, but there is an approximation in diagonalizing the e-p matrices afterwards (the eigenvectors that diagonalize the dynamical matrix are not necesarily the same as those that diagonalize the e-p matrices - the residual of the diagonalization is printed to the log.<br /><br />The better way would be to use either linear interpolation of the matrices or, much better, wannier interpolation. We are working on this, but it doesn't work yet.<br /><br />Increasing elphsmear is not very physical - you are including a large swath of bands around the Fermi level and have a huge effective temperature (0.2 Ha!).<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

I just used the keyword'ep_scalprod=1'，there was an error : read_gkk : enter normsq_gkq    normsq_gkq : calling nmsq_gam_sumFS  p0_19597:  p4_error: interrupt SIGSEGV:11   <br />I don't why.And when I used 'elphsmear=0.2Ha', the linewidths were all positive.So can I choose 0.2Ha？<br />Best wishes！</div>

				<div class="content">For the segfault you need to follow the nettiquette to describe the bug<br /><br />For the 0.2Ha read my previous post - it's not reasonable.</div>
