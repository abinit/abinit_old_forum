				<div class="content">I tried to calculate a Wannier interpolated band structure for CdWO4 but I get unexpected behaviour. With 2x2x2 k-point sampling the agreement with the regular full band structure calculation is poor, with 3x3x3 the result is pretty good and with 4x4x4 I consider the calculation well converged. Now if I try 5x5x5 I get an oscillatory behaviour and with 6x6x6 it gets even worse. The total spread of Wannier functions is about 4 times higher with 5x5x5 and 6x6x6 k-point mesh compared to 4x4x4. Is there a physical basis for why I should get worse results with denser k-point sampling?<br /><br />CdWO4 has a monoclinic lattice with 12 atoms in the unit cell. I first do a scf calculation, followed by nscf, which looks like this:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />acell 9.4719010513 11.133835647 9.5715494332<br />angdeg 90 91.1689443630025 90<br />ntypat 3<br />znucl 48 74 8<br />natom 12<br />typat 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3<br />xred<br />       0.500000000000      0.311514213089      0.750000000000<br />      -0.500000000000     -0.311514213089     -0.750000000000<br />       0.000000000000      0.175217256055      0.250000000000<br />       0.000000000000     -0.175217256055     -0.250000000000<br />       0.244299075739      0.368497627193      0.384328511082<br />      -0.244299075739     -0.368497627193     -0.384328511082<br />       0.244299075739     -0.368497627193      0.884328511082<br />      -0.244299075739      0.368497627193     -0.884328511082<br />       0.201010376569      0.096671554828      0.945575992814<br />      -0.201010376569     -0.096671554828     -0.945575992814<br />       0.201010376569     -0.096671554828      1.445575992814<br />      -0.201010376569      0.096671554828     -1.445575992814<br /><br />ngkpt 3*4<br />nshiftk 1<br />shiftk 3*0<br />nband 70<br /><br />ecut 16<br />pawecutdg 50<br />tolwfr 1d-10<br />nstep 50<br /><br />iscf -2<br />istwfk *1<br />kptopt 3<br />diemac 2.5<br />irdwfk 1<br /><br />prtwant 2<br />w90prtunk 1<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This is my wannier90.win:<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />num_wann 24<br />num_iter 100<br />exclude_bands : 1-34, 59-70<br />num_bands 24<br />bands_plot = .true.<br />begin kpoint_path<br />Z  0 0 0.5 G  0 0 0<br />G  0 0 0 Y  0 0.5 0<br />Y  0 0.5 0 A -0.5 0.5 0<br />A -0.5 0.5 0 B -0.5 0 0<br />B -0.5 0 0 D -0.5 0 0.5<br />D -0.5 0 0.5 E -0.5 0.5 0.5<br />E -0.5 0.5 0.5 C  0 0.5 0.5<br />end kpoint_path<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For conduction bands I have a similar input file except for<br /><br />num_wann 6<br />exclude_bands : 1-58, 66-70<br />num_bands 7<br />dis_froz_max 8.5<br /><br />I attached the results of using ngkpt 3*2, 3*4 and 3*6 (3 attachments is the maximum).

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Doing a successful wannier90 run is complex. You should try different initial projections in your wannier90 input, this should help reducing the total spread of WF.<br />The spread is not an easy quantity to converge, the code gets 'stuck' in local minima all the time. Projections accelerate (a lot) this calculation.<br /><br />Good luck, have fun!<br /><br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks. For the valence band it's easy. For CdWO4<br />begin projections<br /> O:p<br />begin projections<br />accurately describes all 24 projections. I now get better results with denser k-point meshes, although there are still some rapid oscillations along two lines in the BZ. (At least in the important region, around band maximum, the result is good.)<br /><br />I'll see what I can do for conduction bands.</div>

				<div class="content">When you rise the number of k-points you should tune also the energy windows.<br />You could also rise the number of iterations to minimize the spread (in the .win file).<br /><br />At the end, you should find Wannier functions with a very small spread to do a good interpolation.</div>

				<div class="content">One more question. What are the units of the Wannier functions produced by setting wannier_plot true and using the xsf format? If I set isovalue = 1 in xcrysden, does that correspond to 1/Angstrom^1.5?</div>

				<div class="content">The final spreads that you obtain are quite big, one should obtain on the order of 1 ang^2, at max 10, <br /><br />For the valence bands, the algorithm generally finds a good set of Wannier functions.<br />To obtain good Wannier functions from the conduction bands is quite hard.<br />The difficulty comes from the fact that electrons start to be dellocalized, and sometimes we don't know the shape of the molecular orbitals.<br /><br />One method to get physical Wannier functions is to identify a set of isolated many-folds. <br />And do different calculations for each of them.<br />For this you have to identify the chemical character of the orbitals, bonding, etc, and <br />give a very precise initial guess. This can be quite hard to do.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are some methodologies you could try, if you only want to interpolate the eigenvalues.<br />However, the Wannier functions will not be physical (they will not correspond to molecular or atomic orbitals of your system)<br /><br />1) you can try to get both, the conduction and valence bands at the same time,<br />this sometimes works better.<br />Here you should try a highly symmetrical initial guess, even if it is not physical.<br />For example, if you have s and p orbitals, you could try sp3, even if these are not physical.<br />In general, sp3 are more localized than s or p orbitals, so that artifially mixing them will help obtaining localized Wannier functions.<br /><br />2) You could add a big number of Wannier functions, and a bigger number of bands.<br />For this, you can try a highly symmetrical initial guess, and include some random wannier functions.<br />With a big number of iterations (thousands), the procedure should find some localized Wannier functions, which do not correspond to molecular orbitals, of course.<br />But, these can be used to interpolate.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the advice. I added valence and conduction bands together, and got 60.31 Ang^2, although interpolation was worse.<br />With valence and conduction bands separately, I tried ngkpt 8x8x8, num_iter 2000, and got absolutely perfect agreement between interpolated and calculated band structures, even though the total spread was still 57 Ang^2 for the valence band, i.e. 2.4 Ang^2 per MLWF. I also tried to include bands from the next highest valence band into the disentanglement procedure, but with no difference at ngkpt 4x4x4. Then I added the entire second valence and specified 34 initial guesses with O:p Cd:d. Total spread was down to 34.6 Ang^2, but I still get the same oscillations along ZG and BD lines. Also, I'm not sure if I can use sp3 projections for the highest valence band. Specifying O:sp3 would give me 32 projections, more than is required. Which O atoms do I leave out then? From DOS calculations it is clear that the highest valence band is dominated by O 2p orbitals. I'll see what else I can do. Perhaps play more with the energy windows.<br /><br />In the end, If I can accurately interpolate the band structure, I don't see why is it necessary to get a small total spread. My goal is to eventually calculate the quasiparticle band structure.</div>

				<div class="content">Of course each system is different.<br />To obtain good Wannier functions there is not a simple recipy, one has to try several times.<br /><br />Localized Wannier functions (with small spread) are needed to make a good interpolation.<br />If you have large spreads, the interpolated bandstructure may have unphysical flutuations.</div>
