				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />From now on, every answer to a topic contains a little green button on its upper-right corner to mark it as accepted when it solves your issue. If you have trouble locating it, just leave the mouse cursor on each button for a few seconds without moving, in order to let the corresponding help text appear.<br /><br />After thanking the persons who helped you solve your issues, we kindly invite you to click on this little button to mark the topic as solved. This will be very helpful for everybody, since those who encounter the same problem as you in the future will immediately know that you have received a satisfactory answer to this question and be able to quickly pinpoint this answer within the thread.<br /><br />Thank you in advance for your participation,<br /><br />The Forum Moderators.</div>
