				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I had compiled the Abinit-6.4.1 on a dual quad-core cpu system, and the compilation is successful. But when I ran the abinit with 8 core as &quot;mpiexec -n 8 ......&quot;, I found it was much slower than only single-core and the cpu time of 8 core was nearly 2 times longer. I had changed the impi by MPICH2 or OpenMPI, but the problem is still exist. Could anyone give me some suggestions. Thanks!<br /><br />The system environment:<br />Intel Xeon E5430 * 2, 32G RAM<br />RHEL sever 5.5<br />ifort and icc 11.1 and impi 4.0.0.025 (MPICH2 1.3.1 or openmpi 1.4.3)<br /><br />The basic configuration is,<br /><br />../configure FC=mpiifort CC=mpiicc CXX=mpiicpc --enable-mpi=yes --with-mpi-includes=&quot;-I/opt/intel/impi/4.0.0.025/intel64/include&quot; --with-mpi-libs=&quot;-L/opt/intel/impi/4.0.0.025/intel64/lib&quot;<br /><br />and the log files is<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

				<div class="content">Hi  lxbyf,<br />I was running abinit with Xeon E5530x2 and I experimented the same problems.<br />There is another thread concerning this subject (multithreading).<br />The problem is a hardware problem. Your processors are 2 quadri-cores where which one use &quot;hypertreding technology&quot; and &quot;Turboboost&quot; which permit to <br />increase the clock speed when the temperature (so the work on the chip) is small.<br />So when you increase the number of cores you decrease the relative clock speed and the execution time does not scale with the number of procs.<br /><br />Now, I was looking the specifications of your Xeon E5430 and it does not seem to have the same technologies.<br />So my case doesn't seem apply to your case. You should try to run with 1 and 2 cpu to see if the computation scale at least in this case.<br /><br />Another important point. If you are newer with abinit is possible that you didn't put the good parallelization option in the input file.<br />This will imply that you code is running the same code on all procs without a parallelization, so in this case you should have that:<br />time_single = time_eight/8.<br /><br />good luck<br />marco</div>

				<div class="content">Hello lxbyf,<br /><br />I had a look on your log file. A couple of things seem odd to me, especially the fact that a few mpicc tests use gfortran flags instead of the expected Intel backend compiler syntax and a complain about unsuitable mpiexec version. Anyway make sure that you have working mpixxx binaries (check with the &quot;showme&quot; flag that they are calling the right compiler). You mentioned that Abinit compiled fine; did it pass the test suite? I would also suggest to use the latest 6.4.2 production release - no harm to have less bugs. I assume that &quot;mpiexec -n 8 ......&quot; is a typo; use -np 8 instead.<br /><br />It is quite difficult to figure out how you tested the efficiency of the parallel version. Would you please provide a few timings, for example from one of the parallel test suite component. Copy the tests/paral/Input/t_kpt+spin.* files to a new directory, add the tests/Psps_for_tests/26fe.pspnc pseudo file and modify the t_kpt+spin.files last line to reflect the new location. Check the timing for sequential, -np 2, 4, 8 ... it should be quite linear.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br /><br />Thank you for all reply above, it is very useful. I am a newer with abinit, and maybe I test some examples of the beginning tutorial which are not suit for parallelization. And when I test other input files, such as the files &quot;tests/paral/Input/t_kpt+spin*&quot; mentioned, the parallelization is quit efficiency. I found some input files are effective and some are not, so should I put some parallelization options in the input file? And I will check the flags for a new compilation.<br /><br />Unfortunately a new problem appeared in the structure optimization. Wuould you pleased give me some suggestions? Thanks very much.<br /><br /><a href="viewtopicafe4.html?f=9&amp;t=814" class="postlink">http://forum.abinit.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=814</a><br /><br />Best regards,<br />lxbyf</div>

				<div class="content">Have a look at the tutorial and the corresponding input variables ... start with paral_kgb at <a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.4/input_variables/varpar.html#paral_kgb" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.4/input_variables/varpar.html#paral_kgb</a>.<br />The explanation is somewhat catchy. paral_kgb=0 is the default i.e. Abinit will parallelize on k points (assuming that you are calling a parallel Abinit build with mpirun or mpiexec).If paral_kgb=1, extra parallelization (band and/or fft) is enabled which means that you have to set npband and/or npfft otherwise Abinit stops with an error condition (npfft alone is not enough). When the variable is negative, paral_kgb=-n (with n=2,3, ...), Abinit will analyze the possible combinations of parallelization on 2 ... up to n slots (threads here for your SMP system) and give you a clue on the efficiency of the possible values of npkpt, npband and npfft for your input file.<br />So if you &quot;recycle&quot; any kind of test file by running mpiexec -np ... paral_kgb is probably not mentioned and then has the default value; there is no guarantee that the run time of that random test will benefit from k point parallelization even if all processors look busy.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>
