				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I am performing a band calculation (iscf=-2) of 170 bands with PAW pseudopotentials, starting from a density calculated in a previous SCF calculation. The eigenvalues corresponding to all the K points are calculated, but when the mean kinetic energies of the last K point are being written, the process  stops without writing any warning or error.<br /><br />I have performed the same calculation with PAW pseudopotentials for a simpler system and the process runs correctly. My system has a lot of electrons in the unit cell, so I need to compute many bands (that is why I do not perform the calculation with Norm-Conserving PPs).<br /><br />Does anyone know which can be the reason of stopping the process? Any recommendation?<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Nahasamapetilah,<br />It is hard to say what's the problem without any error message... I would suspect you don't have enough RAM memory if this was working for smaller system. Did you check how much memory your calculation is using?<br />All the best,<br />Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Ebousquet, <br /><br />First of all, thank you for your help. I have checked the use of memory: it says that the process should use less than 3733.193 Mbytes. At this moment, without being running the calculation, there are more or less 3 Gbytes free. I think that the problem is the memory, as you suggested. <br /><br />Thank you very much for your help. It has been very useful.</div>
