				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />my public branch fails one test, tv6_43, on the build farm with the failure information<br /><br /> Case_43<br />The diff analysis cannot be pursued : the command sign differ.<br />File 1, line 895, 89 ignored, character: <br />File 2, line 895, 89 ignored, character:=<br /><br />Summary Case_43 : fatal error, see above message<br /><br />This test runs fine on my machine. On my machine line 895 of the output file is a string of &quot;=&quot; signs beginning in the left most column, I assume this is the problem? But I'm not at all sure what I should do about it (my code additions didn't add any output writing). Any help you can suggest would be much appreciated.<br /><br />thanks,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Joe,<br /><br />From the information provided on the buildbot Web pages, you could not identify what was the problem.<br />You should have had access to the full t43.diff file to see what was going wrong. It is planned<br />to give full access to these *.diff files in the future (and no more the 50 last lines).<br /><br />Now, back to your problem : I did access the testf machine, to see what was wrong.<br />It is only a very small problem of portability. Actually, using nstep=10 should fix it.<br />If you agree, I can fix it and proceed with the usual week-end merge with your branch included ...<br />Indeed, this is the only problem of your branch.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Xavier</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br />thanks for the tip. Are the test files always supposed to have an nstep=10 limit? I can add that and push again.</div>
