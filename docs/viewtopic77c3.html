				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I am trying to install abinit 6.10.3 with scalapack support in several of our clusters, and I think I am having trouble becasue of the way we name our blacs libraries. Instead of the usual &quot;libblacs....&quot; all of ours are names &quot;blacs...&quot; What I have tried is to set the linalg flavor to custom, and the linalg libraries to the relevant mkl libraries and scalapack (MKL 10.0, --with-linalg-incs=&quot;-I$MKL_INC&quot; --with-linalg-libs=&quot;-L$MKL_LIB -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl -lguide -lpthread -L$SCALAPACK_LIB -lscalapack $SCALAPACK_LIB/blacs_MPI-LINUX-0.a $SCALAPACK_LIB/blacsF77init_MPI-LINUX-0.a &quot; but configure always tells me that there is no BLACS support and that there is no parallel library support.<br /><br />A usable Makefile is generated, and the MKL libraries are linked correctly when abinit builds, but I also need to include scalapack.<br /><br />I also tried puting the BLACS info on FC_LDFLAGS but I got the same result. Any ideas? Could I simply modify the generated Makefile to force the use of scalapack?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Carlos</div>

				<div class="content">I think I managed to sort this out and, as usual, it was a user issue! I had to hack a bit the provided configure to get some info on why the blacs libraries where not being accepted/found. In case somebody faces this problem, the solution is simple:<br /><br />1) Use the C blacs libraries<br />2) Create local links to the libraries and name them libblacs... so that configure accepts them<br />3) Done<br /><br />I still need to complete the build and do the validation for the scalapack part, but I think this was a simple error on my side. <br /><br />Carlos</div>

				<div class="content">It looks like there were two issues:<br /><br />1) I think the test was looking for the C blacs_gridinit, and I had only included the F77 version of the library in the command line<br />2) Second I had the blacs libraries in the wrong order so there where the usual undefined references and both blacs and scalapack failed to link in the test.<br /><br />I think this is all that there was to it, but let me know if you think otherwise. Let me know if you want me to re-run configure with my old options and send you the exact error messages.<br /><br />Now everything has built without issues, and I can see that the scalapack info is in abinit (&quot;grep pzheevx ./abinit&quot; reports a match). All the sequential tests and the regular parallel tests (seqpar and gw) have passed, but I do not seem to have any pre-packaged tests for scalapack (the option is described in the documentation, but the input files do not exists in /tests).<br /><br />I am not a domain scientist in this area, I work in the performance optimization and evaluation group at the Texas Avanced Computing Center <a href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/" class="postlink">http://www.tacc.utexas.edu</a> and I am trying to make sure we have a package our users can work with confidence. Can you suggest a set of input files in the test directory that I can re-purpose for a scalapack test?</div>
