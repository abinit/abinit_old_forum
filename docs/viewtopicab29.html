				<div class="content">Hi, in my current developments I am finding it VERY convenient to make heavy use of the GSL library. I know that we are supporting this library and I have tested some of my work within abinit using GSL (even have written some new wrappers in c and put them in the 01_gsl directory). As GSL appears to be supported by not mandatory in the build system, is it ok that I am using it? Am I supposed to be providing all the time alternative code to GSL?<br /><br />thanks<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I would say that this is definitely something we should discuss at the Abinit Workshop.<br /><br />GSL is used - rightfully so - by more and more codes in our field. And with the packaging efforts currently in progress, managing it as a dependency will become very easy. I guess we could plan its progressive integration and deployment into Abinit. I'll give you some details about possibilities at the workshop.</div>
