				<h3>PAW structure/positron LT calculus  supercells &amp; overlapping</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi, I have been using Abinit for positron lifetime calculations and I make a few bulk bulk calculations with success (below is an example). As I have researched the positron calculations &quot;In the latest version 6 they are implemented in the PAW framework&quot; so PAW pseudopotencials of the atoms have to be used . My problem is that when I tried <br />to make a  structure optimization or positron lifetime calculation in 2x2x2 supercell (zincblend) with 64 atoms (unit cell of zinclbend is 8) and I get the following error in the log:<br /><br /> chkpawovlp : ERROR -<br />  PAW SPHERES ARE OVERLAPPING !<br />   Distance between atoms   1 and  32 is  :   2.31572<br />   PAW radius of the sphere around atom   1 is:   2.01467<br />   PAW radius of the sphere around atom  32 is:   2.10320<br />   This leads to a (voluminal) overlap ratio of 26.17 %<br /><br />  COMPENSATION DENSITIES ARE OVERLAPPING !!!!<br />   Distance between atoms   1 and  32 is  :   2.31572<br />   Compensation radius around atom   1 is:   2.01467<br />   Compensation radius around atom  32 is:   2.10320<br />   This leads to a (voluminal) overlap ratio of 26.17 %<br />  THIS IS DANGEROUS !, as PAW formalism assume non-overlapping compensation densities.<br /><br />I tried out to reduce the value of  <em class="text-italics">pawecutdg </em> variable so to fix this problem, but eitherway I find myself in the same sittuation. I have to remind that I know that the value<br /><em class="text-italics">pawecutdg </em> has to be greater than <em class="text-italics">ecut</em> so the min. value I set to <em class="text-italics">pawecutdg </em> was 8 (the same value I set to ecut). Any ideas how to work this out?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Example of bulk calculation<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div># Positron calculation<br /># Zincblend structure: ZnSe<br /><br /># Datasets definition<br />  ndtset 3<br /><br />  positron1  0  !

				<div class="content">The error message complains about PAW spheres overlapping  ... seems fair to me as there is only a distance of 2.31 a.u. between a Zn and a Se. Looks very very small to me - there is something fishy in the atomic positions definition. But changing ecut or pawecutdg has a completely different effect and won't improve the situation. Select a suitable ecut after a convergence test (should be around 10-15Ha) and use a pawecutdg around (2.5 * ecut).<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

With this done I re run the abinit but I am afraid I have some bad news...<br /><strong class="text-strong">MEMORY STUFF:</strong> Abinit complains now that &quot;Operating system error: Cannot allocate memory &quot;, I read through forums that I have to modify the     <em class="text-italics"> dilatmx</em> input variable (I am doing structure optimization, because there is a vacancy, before the positron lifetime calculation) and reduce it (how much?) and also reduce <em class="text-italics">ecut</em> (and then also <em class="text-italics">pawecutdg </em>parameter). Is that so? How much? I mean if it is try-error system I would go nuts (each time I run abinit it takes a long time computing, remember now I dealing with a 64 atoms sample).<br />                                                     Kind regards,<br />                                                                           Sergio</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Sergio,<br /><br />If you have a time consuming calculation, optimizing ecut - analyse the convergence of the plane wave cutoff - won't be a loss of time. If you're not the author of the pseudo, look in the accompanying files for ecut recommendations.  And  keep the test plain and simple with a ground state calculation on one unit cell of ZnSe as explained in <a href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.4/tutorial/lesson_paw1.html" class="postlink">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.4/tutorial/lesson_paw1.html</a> i.e. vary ecut from 6 Ha to 20 Ha @ 2 Ha step to find convergence at 1 mHa.<br /><br />For the memory ... are you using a 32bit Abinit binary or 64bit - it looks strange to me that you are exhausting your available RAM. Are you using MPI?<br /><br />Alain</div>

I will try to follow patiently your advice so to see where I find convergence. Respect memory, my main problem, I have 3 GB of RAM but either way I find myself in that sittuation. I sincerly do not know what MPI means (something about parallel computing?). I have to mention that I tried to run the calculus in my PC (the one with 3GB Ram) and also in a cluster with the same result.<br />Varying ecut would finnaly get ride off the memory pŕoblem or I would have to modify other parameters?</div>

				<div class="content">yes, dealing with 64 atoms will require a substantial amount of memory. I suspect that you compiled a 32bit Abinit - it's easy to check that afterwards on Linux with a <div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>file abinit</code></pre></div> ... it should return the ABI of the executable - 32 or 64bit. 32bit is limited to 2GB. You can setup a 64bit compilation with the --enable-64bit-flags configure option.<br />The positive impact on optimizing ecut is speed, not memory (too small and you'll have convergence problem, too high and it slows down the calculation). MPI stands for &quot;message passing interface&quot; and, yes, it is parallel processing. Having a look on your k-points grid, you would certainly benefit from this kind of parallelization.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>

About what version of Abinit I am running, I was sure I was running a 64 bit version of Abinit since I've compliled it in my laptop wich has 64 bit processor and Fedora 12 -64 bits intalled as OS. Eitherway to check it, here is the proof:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&#91;ferrari@BlackIce ~&#93;$ file abinit-6.0.2/src/98_main/abinit<br />abinit-6.0.2/src/98_main/abinit: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.18, not stripped</code></pre></div><br />Now cleared up this part, and clear up that ecut variable has nothing to do with the exahustion of memory, I keep wondering  how to avoid this memory problem. I have two comments to express:<br />1) The example input file I presented in the original post is not the one I am actually trying to run; the actual one is:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># parallelization variables<br /><br />paral_kgb 1<br />npband 1<br />npfft 2<br />npkpt 4<br /><br />wfoptalg 4<br />fft_opt_lob 2<br />fftalg 401<br />iprcch 0<br />istwfk 8*1<br /><br /><br /># Datasets definition<br />&nbsp; ndtset 2<br /><br />&nbsp; optcell1 0<br />&nbsp; # modify nuclear positions but no cell shape and dimension optimization<br />&nbsp; ionmov1 2<br />&nbsp; ntime1 150<br />&nbsp; kptopt1 1<br />&nbsp; occopt1 1<br />&nbsp; ngkpt1 4 4 4<br /><br />&nbsp; positron2&nbsp; 1&nbsp; !

Notice that the procedure I try to run is a structure optization of 2x2x2  diamond/zinc blend  ZnSe supercell with a vacancy (a zinc vacancy) folowed by the common positron lifetime calculation calling the previous calculated electronic density. In the example input file I just run a electronic density calculus without structure optimization (because it was a bulk unit cell and of course there was no need of it)<br /><br />2) K-points grid<br /> Since I have changed to work in a 2x2x2 supercell of 64 atoms, instead of the unit cell of 8 atoms, of course perhaps I shoud change the k-point grid. The  question remaing is how? What is the optimal grid of k-point  that would give good calculation and also would not exhaust the memory?</div>
