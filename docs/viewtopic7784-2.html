				<div class="content">Hello:<br /><br />I have been using ABINIT for a while and one of the important aspects that the tutorial suggests is to check the convergence of tsmear. Well, I did it but I don't know if the values are correct or not. I have a Ti-Pt phase with 17 atoms, triclinic structure. I found that a k-grid of 4x4x4 is good if I want to increase de size of the system, ecut=16 Ha. I create a loop to see the tsmear convergence, but the minimum energy is achieved at 0.07 tsmear (png file attached) which is not close to the values suggested by the tutorial &quot;Default is 0.04 Ha. This should be OK for a free-electron metal like Al. For d-band metals, use 0.01 Ha.&quot; <br /><br />am I doing something wrong, maybe I forgot to add an input variable?<br /><br />I will greatly appreciate your help.<br /><br />Karem<br /><br />Code attached:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># Ti4Pt3<br /><br />ndtset 10<br />tsmear: 0.01&nbsp; &nbsp;tsmear+ 0.01<br /><br />#getwfk -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # This is to speed up the calculation, by restarting<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # from previous wavefunctions, transferred from the old <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # to the new k-points.<br /><br />#Definition of occupation numbers<br />occopt 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; #metallic occupation of levels.

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />In fact the combined tsmear/kpoints convergence is used in a different way. You do not want to find the tsmear that minimize the energy. You want to describe your system as close as possible to the fully converged one within a reasonable amount of time. For this you have to increase your k-point grid. The problem is that for metals, as some states are partially occupied, if the electronic distribution function is a step function, you will need MANY k-points to get something reasonably converged. The trick is to add a smearing (with the variable tsmear) to the distribution function so that you can reach convergence with respect to k-points more rapidly.<br /><br />In brief, you should try to have your k-point grid (a very dense one) converged for a very low tsmear (fixed, something like 0.001 Ha or less) (which would correspond to the &quot;real&quot; step function case). This system is the &quot;reference&quot; one. Then you should compare the convergence of the k-point grid with other values of tsmear (higher tsmear : 0.01 0.02 0.04 ....). At k-point convergence, the properties with this tsmear should be within some tolerance of the properties obtained with the very low tsmear.<br /><br />Usually you do this convergence study for your &quot;test&quot; case, for example the pure system. Then you use the k-point/tsmear parameters you found to use it for further studies (if you want to do GW calculations for example, or defects in a supercell -- in this case if you increase the size of the supercell by 2 in each direction for example, do not forget that the k-point grid can be decreased by 2 in each direction).<br /><br /><br />I hope it helps you<br /><br />David</div>
