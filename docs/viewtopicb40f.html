				<div class="content">Dear all :<br />In order to studied the phonon specter for SrO in B2 phase, we calculated static transition pressure, using the condition of equal enthalpy, the transition pressure obtained is p (t) =30 GPa, (expt =36 GPa), then we calculated phonon specter at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 GPa for B2 phase, our calculated have a soft phonon at p (t) to 66 GPa.  (B2 phase unstable at p (t), 30, 40, 50, 60) but stable at and up 66 GPa.<br />My question is:<br />For B2 phase, is it necessary around to p(t) the phonon specter stable?<br />How to explain the instability for B2 phase up to p(t) to 66 GPa?<br />There is a correlation between phonon stability for B2 phase and transition pressure?<br /><br /> Best regards</div>

				<div class="content">Dear somourad,<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>somourad wrote:</cite>For B2 phase, is it necessary around to p(t) the phonon specter stable? Read for expample, R.~E.~Peirls, {\it Quantum Theory of Solids} (Claredon Press, Oxford, 1956).<br /></div></blockquote><br />Yes, it is. More precisely, above p(t).<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>somourad wrote:</cite>How to explain the instability for B2 phase up to p(t) to 66 GPa?<br /></div></blockquote><br />You could explain it in terms of your thermodynamical stability condition, which you got from the enthalpy comparison (see A.~Mujica {\it et al.}, Rev. Mod. Phys. 75, 863 (2003)). Or from the lattice dynamical point of view (see the book above).<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>somourad wrote:</cite>There is a correlation between phonon stability for B2 phase and transition pressure?<br /></div></blockquote><br />Yes, there is. For these kind of phase transitions, Cochrans' and Andersons' theory of soft modes applies. Please, read W.~Cochran, Adv. Phys. {\bf 9}, 387 (1960) and P.~W.~Anderson, {\it Fizika dielektrikov} (Acad. Nauk SSSR, Moscow, 1960).<br />Usually, enthalpy comparison and lattice dynamics agree on the transition pressure, but not necessarily. Why is it so, I don't know. But it would be nice to find out for specific cases.<br /><br />As it happened to be, a paper on high pressure lattice dynamics of SrO is being published in PRB. Maybe it would be interesting to You to check when it comes out.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Igor Lukacevic</div>
