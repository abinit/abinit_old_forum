				<div class="content">Dear abiniters,<br /><br />I am encountering a little but quite annoying problem.<br />I am performing a cell optimization within a HCP structure, that provides me relaxed cell parameters with a zeroed pressure (-1E-6 GPa).<br /><br />When I reuse these cell parameters and perform a static ground state calculation (just turn off the optcell value and related parameters), I get a non negligible pressure (about -1 GPa)<br /><br />I thought it could be due to Pulay stress or inaccuracies, but the initial cell values are very closed to the final ones and I increased k-point grid and cutoff energy without success.<br /><br />Can anyone have a suggestion to fix this?<br /><br />Here is the cell relaxation input file:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># Ni Primitive Cell <br /><br />autoparal 1<br /><br />prtdos 0<br />prtden 0<br />prtwf&nbsp; 0<br /><br />#Definition of the relaxation parameters<br />optcell 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # kind of cell relaxation<br />tolmxf&nbsp; 1.0d-6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# cell convergence criteria<br />dilatmx 1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # used to avoid Pulay stress<br />ecutsm&nbsp; 0.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # used to avoid Pulay stress<br />strfact 10000.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # stress forces x 100 (accelerate cell relaxation)<br />ionmov&nbsp; 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # kind of atom displacement<br />ntime&nbsp; &nbsp;200&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # number of steps<br /><br /><br />#Definition of the unit cell<br />charge&nbsp; &nbsp;0.0<br />acell&nbsp; &nbsp; 2*4.7202993505&nbsp; 7.8814711929<br />angdeg&nbsp; &nbsp;90.0&nbsp; 90.0&nbsp; 120.0<br /><br />#Definition of the atom types<br />ntypat 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # There is only one type of atom<br />znucl 28&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # The keyword &quot;znucl&quot; refers to the atomic number of the <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # possible type(s) of atom.

				<div class="content">I ran your input file using PAW for nickel--<br /><br />some comments:<br />at least for the PAW set I used, the valence space was 18 electrons, so 36 in your unit cell. Thus 20 bands worked but barely, I increased it to nband 32, which worked better and gave some empty bands even after smearing (which usually helps with convergence).<br /><br />secondly, this system is magnetic, so I ran it with nsppol 2.<br /><br />third, after optimization I also got 1E-6 for stress, and then re-running the new cell I got 1E-2. This is normal and indicates usually that you have to go to pretty dense k point sampling (typical of stress and very typical for metals). You say you got -1 upon re-running, that shows a real problem, maybe because you didn't treat it as magnetic? Anyway, from 1E-6 to 1E-2 is not atypical but shows that very tight convergence parameters are needed if you need to sample very small stress changes.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Pr.  Zwanziger,<br /><br />Thank you for having taking the time to work on my problem.<br /><br />First of all, I want to precise that I use a 10 electron GGA pseudopotential for Ni, so 10 bands per atom was fine, I increased this number without seeing improvement so I came back to that initial number.<br /><br />I am not really interested by magnetic properties, I know it can affect the cell parameter but if I neglect it in the cell optimization run and in the static run, well, I suppose I should not see any effect. Actually, I neglected it in HCP and FCC phase also, and as long as I do not have SCF convergence issue, I am ok with this.<br /><br />These calculations are starting points for a study within a warmed electronic subsystem, and tsmear is both a convergence parameter and the electronic temperature parameter, so it's use is ambiguous to me, and the most important is to get the lowest pressure for a low tsmear value.<br /><br />So, according to these points and from what you tell concerning these stress differences, my best option is to work with a much denser k-point grid. For the FCC cell I worked with a 32x32x32 kpoint grid, got converged up to 1E-6 GPa and static calculation provide something like 1E-2 GPa, this is ok. Maybe I had a too low reciprocal mesh with the HCP structure.</div>
