				<h3>Gw band structure with self-consistent gw + MLWFs</h3>

				<div class="content">Deal All<br /><br />I'm learning the method to calculate the full gw band structure using the self-consistent gw + MLWFs scheme. I've used the &quot;tests/wannier90/Input/t03.in&quot; as a start to perform the study with Abinit 6.2.2 (MPI version, prepared for a x86_64_linux_gnu4.4.) May I ask a couple of questions.<br /><br />Question-1:<br />I tried to separate the run into two parts: part-1 to do gw in parallel and part-2 to run WF in sequential. The Abinit input files for the gw parallel run is t03_part1.in, and those for the WF sequential run is t03_part2.in and t03o_w90.win, (see attachments). In the t03_part1.in I commented out those lines involving the calculation of the quasiparticle Wannier functions (dataset7). In the t03_part2.in I commented out those lines for the ground state and gw calculations but kept the WF part. In the WF sequential run, I used the output files t03o_DS1_DEN, t03o_DS2_WFK and t03o_DS6_QPS obtained from the gw parallel run as inputs. The files were renamed to t03i_DEN, t03i_WFK, t03i_QPS, respectively. Both runs were successfully completed. However, I still would like to ask if my input files and the steps taken are the right approach for the job?<br /><br />Question-2:<br />In order to get a reliable band structure, I understand that convergence studies have to be properly carried out but I am not quite sure how?. Should we do the similar convergence studies as in the case of standard GW? For examples, <br />1. The convergence of GW corrections with respected to ecut and ngkpt used for the ground state and KSS   calculations?<br />2. The convergence of GW corrections with respected to nband, npweps, npwwfn, used in the gw calculations?<br /><br />Or maybe more, such as<br /><br />3. The convergence of GW corrections with respected to the number of self-consistent gw iterations?.<br /><br />All comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Kind Regards,<br />Thanusit Burinprakhon</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Thanusit,<br /><br />     In a low-dimension system, the vacuum size is crucial in GW calculation [PRB 73, 205119(2006)]; if involving transition metal and rare-earth elements, the pseudopotential is very important too.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>
