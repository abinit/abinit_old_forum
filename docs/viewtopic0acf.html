				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I am using the version 7.10.2 of Abinit with parallelization over Kpt/bands/fft and I am encountering a warning I don't really know how to deal with. I am using the code under somewhat extreme conditions and in the log file I have a warning saying that my nband is higher than mpw and therefore I shouldn't expect any good results. I do understand that indeed, the hamiltonian matrix would have a lower rank than the expected number of eigenstates and I should have at best a degeneracy or a crash. But that's not what I get and the results seem pretty reasonable.<br /><br />Furthermore, I don't understand how the mpw number is computed because, when I compute the number of G vectors based on the Ecut I use I have a gigantic number compared to the mpw written in the log file (15720 versus 31). But it seems commensurate if I multiply mpw by the number of processors used. Last, I have a number of bands of 256. So my questions are:<br />- how is mpw computed? is it different in the parallelized case?<br />- shall I worry about my results? or is it actually not mpw that is meaningful in determining the rank of the hamiltonian matrix?<br /><br />Thank you very much in advance for your help.<br /><br />Best.</div>

				<div class="content">This warning is meaningless when paral_kgb == 1, per gmatteo. See <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic5d52.html?f=9&amp;t=3177">viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=3177</a><!-- l --></div>
