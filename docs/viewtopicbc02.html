				<h3>Electron-phonon coupling (EPC)</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi all, <br>
<br>
I'm confused on where to start on an electron-phonon coupling (EPC) calculation. I'm working with a semiconductor, so it seems like the tutorial Eph (<a href="https://docs.abinit.org/tutorial/eph/" class="postlink">https://docs.abinit.org/tutorial/eph/</a>) is not well suited for my problem. Also, this tutorial calculates the Eliashberg function (alpha^2F and lambda), whereas I want the matrix elements of the electron-phonon coupling g_mnv(k,q) that appear in the Hamiltonian H = isolated electronic problem + second quantized phonon problem + g_mnv(k,q)(fermion creation operator_k+q * fermion annihilation operator_k * (boson annihilation operator_q + boson creation operator_-q). <br>
<br>
I've read in a review paper that  this quantity can "be calculated using an alternative, variational formulation of density-functional perturbation theory (Gonze, Allan, and Teter, 1992; Gonze, 1995a, 1997; Gonze and Lee, 1997). A thorough discussion of the connection between the Sternheimer approach and the variational approach to DFPT is provided by Gonze (1995b)."<br>
<br>
<br>
But I've looked through those papers and am unable to find any information on how to calculate the matrix elements. Is this something that I would have to calculate in my own post-process code? What elements of the anaddb output would I need to combine? Are there any examples?<br>
<br>
<br>
***EDIT***<br>
This paper (Liu, A. Y., &amp; Quong, A. A. (1996). Linear-response calculation of electron-phonon coupling parameters. Physical Review B, 53(12), R7575–R7579. doi:10.1103/physrevb.53.r7575 ) references the matrix elements I'm talking about and says The electron-phonon matrix elements, g(nk,n'k',nu), are easily computed from the first-order change in the self-consistent potential." How do I set up a run that would allow me to take a derivative of the first-order changes in the self-consistent potential? What output files would I need and how would they be organized? <br>

The anaddb implementation is mainly designed for metals (conventional superconductors or transport properties in the normal metallic state within the LOVA approximation to the Bolztmann equation).<br>
The code reads e-ph matrix elements produced by the DFPT code (GKK or WF1) files.<br>

Right, the e-ph matrix elements are essential a byproduct of the DFPT calculation. The DFPT code computes &lt;k+q|H(1)|k&gt; where H(1) is the first order (SCF) Hamiltonian induced by a single atomic displacement with wavevector q,<br>
Anaddb reads these matrix elements  and builds the e-ph matrix element &lt;k+q| \Delta V_{q\nu} | k&gt; in the phonon representation.<br>

The main question is "what quantity do you want to compute with these e-ph matrix elements" as there are several physical properties whose evaluation requires the knowledge of the e-ph matrix elements.<br>
Note that we are gonna have a new implementation of EPH properties that is directly interfaced with Abinit.<br>
<br>
Some of these features have been briefly discussed in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465519303741" class="postlink">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/a ... 5519303741</a><br>
(see the Section "Progress in electron–phonon calculations with Abinit"),<br>
For a more detailed analysis and comparison between the new implementation and anaddb see<br>
the more recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465519303741" class="postlink">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/a ... 5519303741</a><br>
<br>
If you are interested in phonon-limited mobilities, I would suggest to have a look at<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00630.pdf" class="postlink">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00630.pdf</a><br>
<br>
Not all the features (and optimizations) are available in Abinit9.0, nevertheless one can compute the electron-phonon self-energy and phonon-induced lifetimes with the new implementation.<br>
A new tutorial for E-Ph is being written and it will be released in the next version.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Dr. Matteo, <br>
<br>
Thanks for the thorough response. I checked out "The Abinit Project: Impact, environmen, and recent developments." From the description in Sect 3.3, it sounds like Abinit already does what I want: "To address these limitations, abinit v8 provides a new driver explicitly designed to compute the EPH matrix elements and related physical properties. A different philosophy is used, in which EPH matrix elements are computed directly starting from the basic ingredients, namely, the ground-state wavefunctions stored in the WFK file, and the first-order change of the Kohn-Sham (KS) potential produced by the DFPT code." I have v.8.10.2, so should have these capabilities. <br>
<br>
I want to calculate the e-ph coupling constants themselves, as defined in eqn 1 in that Liu paper. They are also defined in eqn 4 of this paper (10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.837) where the pseudopotential total-energy method was introduced to calculate the e-ph coupling constants g_mnv(k,q). <br>
<br>
It sounds like with the proper flags and control of databases, Abinit stores the matrix elements that you wrote &lt;k+q| \Delta V_{q\nu} | k&gt;. So my question is how do I access those? What would their units be? Does the calculation differ from the eph tutorial that is aimed at metals? <br>
<br>
Cheers, <br>
