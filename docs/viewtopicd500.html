				<h3>Thermodynamics of SrO</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear colleagues,<br /><br />My problem is the following: I've calculated the thermal expansion coefficient of SrO in NaCl phase. The shape of its behaviour with increasing T is adequate, but all the values are by 4 order of magnitude larger than usual (10^-5).<br /><br />My rf calcs. (phonon freqs. - wj) are in a very good agreement with experiments and previous DFT calcs. Room temperature S and Cv are also in a very good agreement with exp. data.<br /><br />To calc. the thermal expansion coefficient I used an equation (14) given in PRB 50, 17054 : (1/3B0)*SUM(gj*Cvj). It depends on B0 (equilibrium bulk modulus), gj (Grueneisen parameters) and Cvj (phonon contribution to the constant volume specific heat). For B0 I got close to previous results (it doesn't influence the results much). I gave it in J/Bohr^3. For gj I got the values between 2 and -4 (I have soft modes in NaCl phase). For gj I did finite difference of ln's, with freqs given in Ha and volumes in Bohr^3. Later I tried with freqs in Hz, but I got the same values. Cvj I got from equations (4) and (5) in PRB 68, 224304 : Cvj = k*exp(hbar*wj/k*T)*(hbar*wj/k*T * 1/(exp(hbar*wj/k*T)-1))^2. Boltzmann constant I gave in J/K, hbar in Js, T in K and wj in Hz.<br /><br />Just to mention, when one uses expression (16) from PRB 50, 17054 for Cvj and explicitly does the T derivation, one gets the same formula as in PRB 68, 224304, except that an equilibrium volume V0 appears in the denominator besides B0 (so, its (1/3B0V0)...). But in this case, I think that units in the expression do not give K^-1 needed for the thermal expansion coefficient. But even including the volume here, the results are still 2 orders of magnitude too large. I think volume should be not here.<br /><br />When all is summed up, I get the above problem. I just cannot find the source of it. I would appreciate any thought, criticism and ideas on this issue and my way of doing it.<br /><br />Thank you all in advance!<br /><br />Yours,<br />Igor Lukacevic</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Igor,<br /><br />1) if you have soft modes, formally you should not be doing any thermodynamic integration (S, Cv, or the expansion coefficient...)<br />2) if this is not the problem, you probably have a missing conversion factor. More numerically, what is the difference between your curve and experiment? The Gruneisen parameters sound ok in magnitude, which leaves the Cvj - they should sum to Cv, correct? Is that the case? It looks strange that the Cvj have a factor of k out front. Transforming that to atomic units is tricky.<br /><br />ciao<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

Is it because of the strongly negative Grun. parameters? Or some numerics in the expressions for them? But, then, how could I get a good results for Cv and S?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>2) if this is not the problem, you probably have a missing conversion factor.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I'll check again, although I did that already I don't know how many times.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>More numerically, what is the difference between your curve and experiment?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't know. I cannot find any exp. (or theor.) paper reporting this quantity.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>The Gruneisen parameters sound ok in magnitude, which leaves the Cvj - they should sum to Cv, correct?

I looked at at least a dozen of papers reporting an expression for Cvj, and every one of them has a k in front.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>mverstra wrote:</cite>Transforming that to atomic units is tricky.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />Why atomic units? Shouldn't I be doing in SI system?<br /><br /><br />Igor</div>

Linear thermal exp. coeff. is 13.72x10^(-6) at around room temp. So, volumnic thermal coeef. would be about 3 times that, 41.16x10^(-6). And I get 0.364823<br /><br />Igor</div>

Anaddb just ignores them, but this is incorrect formally. It could be that most of the Cv and S come from the other modes, but that would be luck.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ilukacevic wrote:</cite>How come it's  strange?
