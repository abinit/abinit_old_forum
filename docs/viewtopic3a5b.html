				<div class="content">Dear abiniters,<br /><br />I experienced a SIGBUS (or SIGSEGV depending on the machine's mood) with abinit-7.6.2 here:<br />=&gt; 70_qw/calc_vhxc_me.F90: line  526 : ABI_FREE(kinpw)<br />This is not a limited memory problem as it is quite often the case.<br />(i have 20GB for a bulk test calculation (2 atoms, 8 k-points in IBZ, reduced cut-offs etc.) (all tests on 1 and 2 cpus)<br /><br />SIGSEGV usually points to array bound violation which is what i found. Debugging:<br />1/ the array kinpw is allocated with a size npw_k = Wfd%Kdata(ik_ibz)%npw which is the number of plane waves at the current k-point<br />  70_qw/calc_vhxc_me.F90: line  428 : ABI_MALLOC(kinpw,(npw_k))<br />2/ it is then passed to mkkin() to calculate the kinetic energy at this k-point for all plane waves but up to Wfd%npwwfn plane waves.<br />  -&gt; Wfd%npwwfn is not k-dependent (absolute maximum number of pw for any k-point?) and always larger than npw_k (this has been checked)<br />  70_qw/calc_vhxc_me.F90: line  430 : call mkkin(Dtset%ecutwfn+0.1_dp,Dtset%ecutsm,Dtset%effmass,Cryst%gmet,kg_k,kinpw,kpt,Wfd%npwwfn)<br />3/ the loop in mkkin() fills the kinpw array without condition for all elements ( 1 : npw=Wfd%npwwfn )<br />  56_recipspace/mkkin.F90: line  107 : do ig=1,npw<br />  56_recipspace/mkkin.F90: line  136 : kinpw(ig)=kinetic/effmass<br />So, the code writes data somewhere unallowed...<br /><br />Now the weird part:<br />1/ The signals show up only in self-consistent GW (gwcalctyp&gt;=20) with PAW (no spin-orbit).<br />2/ The signals do not show up in one shot GW (default gwcalctyp) with PAW, or any GW with NC psps, even though kinpw() bounds are exceeded.<br /><br />What is reassuring is that in calc_vhxc_me(), the elements beyond bounds kinpw(npw_k:Wfd%npwwfn) are not referenced.<br />However, SIGBUS or SIGSEGV showing up means that the pointer to kinpw() is somewhere ill-defined when deallocating (is that right?).<br />The fact that this 'somewhere' depends on the psps used and/or the type of GW calculation may point to an initialization dependent behaviour (wavefunctions etc.).<br />I hope that with PAW, kinpw(npw_k:Wfd%npwwfn) do not actually overwrite existing data. I didn't have a look on how ABI_MALLOC() works...<br /><br />To solve the problem i just substituted &quot;npw_k&quot; to &quot;Wfd%npwwfn&quot; in the call to mkkin() which is what was intended i think.<br />No more SIGBUS or SIGSEGV (even for larger calculations with less available memory).<br />I'd like to have a feedback from developpers please.<br />I have two questions:<br />1/ am i doing anything wrong with this substitution?<br />2/ am i missing something (bug cause, solution, bug consequences etc.)<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Eric Tea</div>

				<div class="content">I had exactly the same problem. In mkkin.F90 I changed<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>do ig=1,npw</code></pre></div><br />to<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>do ig=1,min(size(kinpw),npw)</code></pre></div><br />which, I think, is effectively the same thing you did. Also, I had to change<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>real(dp),intent(out) :: kinpw(npw)</code></pre></div><br />to<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>real(dp),intent(in out) :: kinpw(:)</code></pre></div><br />after which it got past line 526 in 70_qw/calc_vhxc_me.F90. However, it still crashed at some later time (during the 2nd round of screening of QP corrections, don't remember anymore; originally I complained about it in here <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic162c.html?f=11&amp;t=1922">viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1922</a><!-- l -->). Hopefully some developer can comment on this issue.</div>
