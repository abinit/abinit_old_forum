				<div class="content">Hello to all,<br />I am trying to include a new feature in ABINIT (LOTF: learn on the fly, another method to compute MD steps).<br />This method was developed some time ago for an old version of ABINIT (5.4) but never committed.<br />Now I have to put all the existent code in a new version (7.0) and I have some doubts.<br /><br />In version 5.4, the essential of the LOTF code consisted to put a new method in src/21drive/moldyn.F90  when the variable ionmov was equal to 14.<br />As in the recent versions the subroutine moldyn.F90 has disappeared, I am asking to myself if the subroutine src/95drive/move.F90  is the descent of <br />moldyn.F90 or not. <br />Is it correct?<br /><br />What I can understand from the code is that I have to create a new subroutine src/45_geomoptim/pred_loft.F90  containing  the new method and then<br />call it in src/95drive/move.F90 when ionmov has the corresponding value (I think to set it to 31, following the present list).<br />Is it all correct?<br /><br />thanks.<br />Best regards,<br />Marcp</div>
