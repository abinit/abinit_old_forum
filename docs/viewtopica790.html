				<h3>Recalculating electronic polarization from ground state orbitals and orbitals differentiated with respect to k</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear developers,<br>
<br>
I would like to recompute the polarization as given in equation 1.26 of <a href="https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/files/PhD-M.Veithen.pdf" class="postlink">https://www.abinit.org/sites/default/fi ... eithen.pdf</a>. I have calculated the ground state orbitals and have written to disk the orbitals that have been differentiated with respect to k for AlAs (<a href="https://docs.abinit.org/tutorial/ffield/index.html" class="postlink">https://docs.abinit.org/tutorial/ffield/index.html</a>). <br>
<br>
I am then using abipy (abipy.waves.wfkfile) to read in the orbitals and compute equation 1.26 but do not get the same values as computed in abinit (I also get a complex part). Is there something I am missing here in my computation?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Kevin</div>

I'm not sure if I understand, but you want to compute the polarization through the Berry phase, I guess you did it with berryopt=-1 with Abinit, right?<br>
Now, you have to be careful with quantum of polarization problem, see for example:<br>
<a href="http://palata.fzu.cz/abinitschool/download/We3_polarization.pdf" class="postlink">http://palata.fzu.cz/abinitschool/downl ... zation.pdf</a><br>
I did not know Abipy is computing the Berry phase polarization, are sure about it, can you give the doc/info telling you that?<br>
Best wishes,<br>

				<div class="content">Hi Eric,<br>
<br>
Thank you for the response. With the formula that I showed, you can compute the polarization once you have the derivatives of the Kohn-Sham orbitals with respect to k. This could be done with berryopt -1 (or -3 if you want the derivatives of the orbitals written) or with DFPT. <br>
<br>
For abipy, it itself does not compute the polarization. But it does have the ability to read the WFK files and therefore I am reading in all of the orbitals along with the derivatives of the orbitals and I am trying to compute the polarization manually.<br>
<br>
I hope this info makes it more clear.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Kevin</div>
