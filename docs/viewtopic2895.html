				<div class="content">What does &quot;the results are not correct&quot; mean? You show many steps and I don't know if you validated the first ones, and where things stop working.<br /><br />First off, you should converge everything (k, ecut) in particular pawecutdg seems much too small. <br /><br />nband might also be too small if there are unconverged empty bands which enter in the algorithm - with perturbations they can become important.<br /><br />For the physics you might have to add van der Waals with Cs and Pb atoms.<br /><br />Are you sure that the geometry relaxations finished properly? You limit the number of steps a lot.<br /><br />For the ddk you should not have nqpt 1<br /><br />Start with that and see if things improve, and you should start with a few more phrases about what you are trying to do...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Nawzad,<br /><br />what does &quot;gamma point is not relaxed&quot; mean? Do you get something absurd, 10% off, 20%? <br /><br />Also, first tell us how close you are in lattice and structure. <br /><br />Some datasets may have &quot;finished&quot; all of their iterations, but if the tolerance is not satisfied the results will be bad. <br /><br />Are you actually using PAW?

				<div class="content">It is not possible to use PAW with NC potentials. In QE I think this is an option because all of their potentials are in the same format, but it's still unorthodox (evil and wrong) to mix the two. If you give abinit NC potentials in the files file, it will not run PAW. If you give it a mix of paw and NC datasets, it should stop.<br /><br />If you have an unstable mode, the relaxed elastic tensor will be wrong, so we have to back up a bit. Did you check the convergence of all the DFPT runs as I suggested in the previous post? How much of an instability do you get?<br /><br />Next, how well did you relax the initial structure (perhaps 30 steps was not enough, and you can check forces and stresses in your initial GS run, before the DFPT, using the copied relaxed coordinates)? <br /><br />Next, check the eigenvector of the unstable mode - it will tell you which way the system wants to distort - if this breaks symmetry, and you are sure the phase you gave it is the correct GS, then perhaps your pseudopotential is not good enough for this phase, or you are not converged enough in ecut, k, etc... Converging the GS is not enough to guarantee the DFPT will be as well. In passing, your dilatmx and ecutsm should be the same _everywhere_ (relaxation, GS, DFPT) otherwise you can easily get unstable modes. I think this is not the case in your inputs, which will change the basis set of plane waves, and break the relaxation convergence etc... you did previously.<br /><br />You should read the abinit forum nettiquette <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopica857.html?f=20&amp;t=251">viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=251</a><!-- l --> - we need more info in general, on platform, version, outputs etc... Most of my questions could be answered by reading your output directly...</div>

				<div class="content">Dear all,<br />A small comment here. Elastic response is very very (I really insist  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /> ) sensitive. To be sure your relaxed structure is OK you have to perform a single point energy with the structure and parameters you will use for DFPT calculation and check if forces and stresses are as small as you expected after the relaxation. If you have such a problem of &quot;instability&quot; could you report the output of this &quot;single point energy&quot; calculation of the relaxed structure such that we can see if this is OK?<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>
