				<div class="content">Dear ABINITers,<br /><br />is there a way to directly calculate the <strong class="text-strong">effective mass</strong> with ABINIT? A naïve approach would be to fit a curve (locally: 2nd order polynomial) to the band structure and take the second derivative. Does this work? How can I get the band structure, e.g. near Gamma, with sufficient accuracy? Wannier interpolation?<br /><br />Thanks &amp; Best regards,<br /><br />Martin Haeufel<br />TU Munich, WSI (T33)<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.wsi.tum.de/">http://www.wsi.tum.de</a><!-- m --></div>

The easiest probably is to rescale the branches of band structure which you are fitting, to express the k axis in bohr-1, then fit and you will have m* in clean atomic units. Just multiply the reduced k-point you input to abinit by the reciprocal lattice vectors (search for PRIM in the output file), and don't forget a 2*pi factor where needed: the reciprocal lattice in abinit is strict bohr-1, without the 2pi<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> How can I get the band structure, e.g. near Gamma, with sufficient accuracy?

Are there any tutorials/papers on this? Are there any systematic ways/ external tools to get a weighted set of k-points that contain the high-symmetry points for the given structural symmetry? I used to have access to Materials Studio at Qimonda, which I think had this as a built-in feature. Or would this just lead to a very inefficient k-point set and one should use interpolation anyway?<br /><br />Martin</div>
