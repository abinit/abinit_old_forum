				<div class="content">Dear colleagues,<br /><br />I am subscribed to many forums to receive the e-mail notifications, when someone posts a message to them. But in the last several weeks, this option seems not to function. I do not receive any e-mail, although when I log in, I see there are new posts. Likewise, I do not receive anymore the daily summary of new posts.<br />In my user details, the list of subscribed forum is still there.<br /><br />Could someone explain why is it happening. These notifications were very useful to me.<br /><br />Thank You in advance.<br /><br />Igor Lukacevic<br /><br />PS. If this question does not belong to this forum, I apologize; please ignore it or move it as appropriate.</div>

				<div class="content">Igor,<br /><br />it's not so oddly : two days before, the subscription was to &quot;None&quot; and I forced it to &quot;Day&quot;<br /><br />I suspect that, the last update of Digest module resets all subscriptions...<br /><br />happy that it works...<br /><br />jmb</div>
