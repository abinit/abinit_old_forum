				<div class="content">Hello everybody,<br /><br />I have a (very small) feature request. I can not really implement it myself, as the scprqt routine is unreadable and too complex, and I'm not even sure it is the place to code.<br /><br />I would like a non-scf run to print out a line (at least to log) with the convergence of the wfr as a function of iteration. As it stands, it prints out nothing until the end of the convergence (as we are in a single &quot;scf&quot; step). For large and complex systems I have no idea what is going on or how much longer it will take, and my nonSCF runs can last weeks.<br /><br />Would someone who knows where to put this add a small print statement? I would like the equivalent of <br />ETOT xx xx xxx xx<br />in the non-SCF case. Pretty please. With sugar on top.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Matthieu<br />(COTFC)</div>
