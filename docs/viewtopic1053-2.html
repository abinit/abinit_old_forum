				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />I had recently finished making a new utility for Abinit called fold2Bloch. This utility unfolds first-principle electronic band structure obtained with Abinit code. How would I go about making a stand alone distribution package which can be added on to already installed Abinit? We are currently working on getting fold2Bloch to be included as part of the WIEN2K distribution package, and hope that it will also be included in Abinit distribution eventually.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Anton Bokhanchuk</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />As far as the license goes, it is a free package to be used by the public just like Abinit (I believe GPLv3). The WIEN2K implementation was mentioned in the following article <a href="http://www.tbrri.com/~orubel/publications/2014/Rubel_PRB_90_115202.pdf" class="postlink">http://www.tbrri.com/~orubel/publications/2014/Rubel_PRB_90_115202.pdf</a>, which will help you understand the purpose and capabilities of the package. Thus, our goal is to spread this software amongst the scientific community. We are currently reviewing the development rules and documentation, and from our understanding we need a Bazaar account. Who would we contact in order to open an account with Bazaar?<br /><br />PS<br />Attached is an example of the band structure for Ga8As7Bi1 supercell. After processing Abinit WFK file with fold2Bloch package we obtained the same results as from WIEN2K <a href="https://github.com/rubel75/fold2Bloch/wiki/Tutorial-2:-Bismuth-in-GaAs" class="postlink">https://github.com/rubel75/fold2Bloch/wiki/Tutorial-2:-Bismuth-in-GaAs</a></div>

				<div class="content">Since your package is stand-alone, you don't have to request any Abinit branch nor to distribute it with Abinit. From what I see on GitHub, you are already offering everything your users need. It is thus probably sufficient that we advertise your code on the Abinit-related websites. The only aspect we have to care about is which versions of Fold2Bloch are compatible with which versions of Abinit.<br /><br />Please let me know if I misunderstood something and it is really important for your package to be made part of Abinit.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />Thanks for reviewing the fold2Bloch. However, in order for it to to read _WFK files which are generated by Abinit I am using some of the Abinit functions and types in my main F90 file (fold2Bloch.F90):<br />hdr_io()<br />wfk_open_read()<br />wfk_read_band_block()<br /><br />So for this reason, my understanding is that it has to be compiled with Abinit.<br /><br />Please see the attached copy of fold2Bloch.F90. Maybe this will make it more clear of what I'm trying to do.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Anton</div>

				<div class="content">If you want to go on in this direction, I thus suggest you to contact Xavier Gonze directly to organize the inclusion of Fold2Bloch into Abinit. Before that, I recommend you to:<br /><ul>  <li> fix typos;<br />  </li><li> replace tabs by spaces in your source files;<br />  </li><li> replace calls to write(*,*) by calls to Abinit's wtrout routine;<br />  </li><li> have a look at the initialization part of the other main executables in src/98_main/ and try to do something similar in Fold2Bloch;<br />  </li><li> provide a tutorial.</li></ul><br />An alternative could be to use ETSF_IO in Abinit to write the wavefunctions and read them in this format in Fold2Bloch, which would give you more freedom and keep your project independent from Abinit. There are pros and cons in both cases, the choice is up to you.</div>
