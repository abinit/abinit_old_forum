				<h3>Possible bug when running DFT+U calculations</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear developers,<br /><br />I am trying to make some calculations with CdTe. The DFT+U method is commonly used in the literature to correct for the localised Cd d-electrons. Therefore, I have attempted to do the same thing within Abinit by adding a Hubbard potential U to the Cd 4d electrons. I am using the latest PAW datasets for Cd (12 valence electrons: 4d, 5s) and Te (6 valence electrons: 5s, 5p) found in the JTH PAW atomic datasets table (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.abinit.org/ATOMICDATA/048-cd/index.html">https://www.abinit.org/ATOMICDATA/048-cd/index.html</a><!-- m -->). <br /><br /><br />However, whenever running a calculation, I receive the following warning in the logged output every time:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>WARNING<br />src_file: m_invars1.F90<br />src_line: 1904<br />message: |<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; usedmft and usepawu are both activated <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; This is not an usual calculation:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; usepawu will be put to a value &gt;= 10:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LDA+U potential and energy will be put to zero<br /></code></pre></div><br />and this despite a DMFT calculation not being activated. In fact, I explicitly set usedmft to 0 to insure that it is not activated. See my .in input file below:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code># Crystalline cadmium-telluride: computation of the total energy(Hartee or eV)<br />#PAW<br /><br /># 1.

That is, when the Full localised limit (FLL) double-counting correction term is used. On the other hand, when using the Around mean field (AMF) double-counting correction term, there is indeed no significant effect of the U potential on the investigated parameters - lattice parameter, band gap, bulk modulus. See the attached figure below for a comparison of when using FLL versus AMF on the parameters as a function of U.<br /><div class="inline-attachment">

			</div><br />Furthermore, when looking at the DOS - in the case of when using FLL, the Cd 4d electron states shift as is expected. However, when using AMF, the DOS are not effected regardless of which U potential is being used.<br /><br />Therefore, it seems to me that the warning message is sent regardless of if the FLL or AMF double-counting correction term is used, but that in the case of FLL nothing actually changes. However, in the case of AMF, it seems that the U potential is in fact set to 0.<br /><br />I should mention that I was getting exactly the same results when using Abinit version 8.0.8, the only difference when switching to version 8.10.2 was that the warning message started appearing. Furthermore, I have done the same test with ZnO and it showed the same results in that when using FLL the U potential made a difference, but with AMF U does nothing.<br /><br />Is this possibly a bug or am I missing something?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />kalkm1</div>

				<div class="content">Dear kalkm1,<br />The error message with dmft is indeed a bug, and this should have been corrected in the latest version...<br />For the problem of AMF, I've asked the developer to respond to that, lets see. Otherwise, U of FLL with J=0 should be very similar to AMF.<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Dear kalkm1,<br /><br />Thank you for your message. Indeed the warning is a bug and will not appear  in the next version of ABINIT.<br /><br />Concerning the calculation with FLL wrt to AMF:<br />To check that U is not zero in the AMF, you should look to the log file and look for DFT+U energies.<br /><br />I am not used to DFT+U for such systems.<br />However, it might be that as the d shell is filled (in CdTe and ZnO), all occupations are equal and thus  DFT+U/AMF potential, in this case, is very weak (it is what the formulas of AMF suggest, see e.g. Phys. Rev. B 77, 155104 ), whereas FLL DFT+U potential is large.  You should have a different behavior  for systems in which the d shell is not completely filled (such as NiO). Did you check any other systems than CdTe and ZnO  ?<br /><br />Best regards<br />Bernard</div>
