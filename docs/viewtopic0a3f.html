				<div class="content">Hello,<br />I have ran the code and created a NSCF calculation output file. While using AbinitBandStructureMaker.py, it plots the spin up band values (eigenvalues) correctly, but for the life of me, I cannot find out how to plot both the spin up and spin down bands by using AbinitBandStructureMaker.py on the same plot<br />This is crucial because it is a semiconductor and the spin up band is below the Fermi level while the spin down bands are above the Fermi level (or the HOMO band for spin up and down). I do not want to have to run abinit again to create the spin down, because it is all ready within the output file that has been created. <br />Can anyone tell me how to plot both spin up and down band structures without having to write my own script. I want them to both exist on an x y plot where you can directly see the overlap and especially the positions of each HOMO band in relation to the Fermi level</div>

				<div class="content">Correction to my initial question. I am kind of stupid to not realize this, but I thought I would share just to clear up my problem. To get the plots for spin up and spin down cases, you must run a spin up calculation and get a band structure, then run a spin down bawn calculation and get the band structure. You then combine the 2 plots together to get a spin up and down band structure plot.</div>

				<div class="content">A spin polarized calculation will provide both spin channels (2 sets of bands) at once... What you make of it with ABSmaker is something else.<br /><br />Does your last post mean that the issue is resolved? Please flag it with the green tick if that is the case</div>

				<div class="content">I ended up developing my own script to deal with this particular problem. This is fairly easy because I am working with a 1-dimensional wire where the main band character lies on the z vector. The overall issue with AbinitBandStructureMaker.py has not been resolved.<br />My band structure is an XY plot, but if I needed an XYZ plot for a more complicated band structure, my script would have been more complicated to form. I have not yet found a way to use AbinitBandStructureMaker.py script to solve this issue for bands needing a spin up/spin down representation.<br /> Just to be clear, the abinit package supplies spin up and spin down eigenvalues for each k point, it was just a post processing issue.</div>
