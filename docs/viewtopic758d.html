				<h3>[Q]parallel run with gamma point calculations</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi, I am testing surface problems with large vacuum space. <br />Using gamma point (kpt=0,0,0,) run, I am trying to run parallel run calculations as:<br /><br /># for 2-CPU run<br />paral_kgb 1<br />npkpt 1<br />npband 2<br />npfft 1<br />bandpp 1<br /><br />Because there is a single K-point, npkpt is given as 1. I am trying to configure npband or npfft. But this run shows slower results than a single CPU run (77 -&gt; 103 sec for 10 SCF loops). A test problem has 58 bands and  40x40x160 FFT grids. <br /><br />Are options right? Or the tested problem is too small for parallel run check? I tried different npband/npfft with different number of CPUs but still results are not good (getting worse for more CPUs). Any comment will be very appreciated.<br /><br />ByoungSeon</div>

				<div class="content">When doing parallelisation over bands, make sure the communications between CPU's are efficient or have it work on the same node to share memory. I for instance had a very bad efficiency (almost factor of then) when doing a job requiring 8 CPU's when it was being distributed on different nodes instead of one same node...</div>

				<div class="content">You are probably right that the problem is small. Hard to see speed up on 2 procs as well. Above all, the execution time is small, so you will have a large fraction of system time (start up, file i/o etc...) and some pollution if there are other processes around. <br /><br />Have you checked what Nicolas mentioned, that the processes truly are being distributed by your mpi implementation and batch system?<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Hi.<br /><br />Thanks for the comments and help.<br />Yes, I have been testing the jobs on SMP or multiple-core machines, not distributed environment.<br />But the still efficiency is not good. Or do I need any other compiling options? I used a following command for configuration.<br /><br />./configure --enable-mpi --with-mpi-level=2 --prefix=/home/aaa/abinit FC=/opt/ompi143/bin/mpif90<br /><br />Do I have to configure openMP or Pthreads?<br /><br />As mentioned before, parallel run is very good on multiple K-points. Problem is that parallel calculations on a gamma point<br />calculation (a single K-point) is not good. <br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />ByoungSeon</div>

				<div class="content">I leave some observations regarding gamma point parallelism.<br /><br />1. For Xeon desktop (6corexhyperthread=12 threads) with intel fortran compiler didn't yield (?) any speed up in gamma point parallelism.<br /><br />2. For AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 6176, 48 cores, with open64 5.0, 45x45x216 ngfft size problem, parallel option is given as:<br />paral_kgb 1<br />npkpt 1<br />npband 8 #---&gt; change as 1, 2, 4, 8<br />nband 120<br />npfft 1<br />bandpp 1<br /><br />20 SCF loops are done and the wall times are:<br />1cpu = 908.4 sec<br />2cpu = 743.4sec<br />4cpu = 385.6sec<br />8cpu = 245.1sec<br /><br />There might be some overheads but gamma point parallelism seems working good. But also hw/compiler might be double-checked.<br /><br />B.</div>
