I met the same problem when i doing the FULL DFPT calculation with PAW-PP<br>

What is the error message you get?<br>
With DFP+U there were a small bug in the code and it was frozen in the 8.10.3. This has been solved since a while but not sure if this is fixed in 8.10.3...<br>

Here is the WARNING massage i got<br>
<br>
pawio_print_ij: WARNING -<br>
  The matrix seems to have high value(s) !<br>
  ( 64 components have a value greater than   50.0).<br>
  It can cause instabilities during SCF convergence.<br>
  Action: you should check your atomic dataset (psp file)<br>
          and look for "high" projector functions...<br>
<br>
I haven't apply the Hubbard U for my calculation yet.<br>
So I think the problem is cause by the FULL DFPT + PAW<br>
Since it cause the divergence in my 2DEtotal during the perturbation,so i just quit the job for now<br>
and change to the NC-PP.<br>

Dear torrent<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot for the comment.<br>
I wonder is there any way to deal with the divergence total energy (2DEtotal) in perturbation without changing the PAW to NCPP?<br>
I try both the general Atomic dataset and the one from GBRV table . They both leads to the weird divergence during the perturbation. (2DEtotal up to 10^30 Hatree)<br>
BTW, I am looking forward the v9.0. You guys are doing amazing job!<br>

				<div class="content">Dear Andy,<br>
Regarding the divergence of the SCF, it can be specific for each case. The first thing would be to play with the mixing parameters (diemix, diemixmag if magnetism, nline, etc) see if reducing them could improve the situation.<br>

Thanks for the advise , i was trying to tune the mixing parameters and see the results.<br>
It doesn't seems to be better while doing perturbation. I will keep trying on this.<br>

				<div class="content">Dear Andy,<br>
How to tune mixing parameter is something coming from experience but in general the best to have them as large as possible such that you reduce them step by step to see when this can improve your case.<br>
By the way, at this stage it'll be hard to help you without knowing which system are you running on, I've made several tests of DFPT+PAW (with and without U) and most of them go smoothly without much tuning mixing. Is your system converging well during ground state or relaxation?<br>

Thanks for the reply.<br>
Sorry, I was busy from another project recently so i haven't do many tests, but there is still some progress and will be take on later.<br>
The system i am running is a monolayer CrI3 ,  my system is well converge during ground state and relaxation. <br>
The only thing might cause the problem is that for the monolayer CrI3, the ground state energy with AFM and FM state is extreme close( 0.001 Ha difference). <br>
But there's another topic i was trying to solve is that i cannot do the FM calculation in the FULL DFPT<br>
<a href="viewtopic1812.html?p=12726#p12726" class="postlink">viewtopic.php?p=12726#p12726</a><br>
<br>
I don't know if that cause the problem or not.<br>
I will try to do more test about mixing parameter.<br>

Yes this can be a problem, when you are close to phase transitions, the energy landscape flattens and things have tendency to diverge... diemix and diemixmag could do the job here, but they might need to be small and requiring more SCF... You can also increase nline to 10 or 12 to help.<br>
<br>
For the FM, you could switch to metallic occupation (and putting a small tsemar if insulating) as stated in the post you mention, did you try it?<br>

Yes i have tried this way at first. but seems like the code won't let me do the calculation.<br>
It's sending the ERROR message:<br>
<br>
chkint_prt: ERROR -<br>
Context: the value of the variable usepead is 0.<br>
Context: the value of the variable optdriver is 5.<br>
The value of the input variable occopt is 4, while it must be<br>
equal to 1<br>
Action: you should change one of the input variables occopt,<br>
usepead or optdriver.<br>
<br>
So i tried the spinmagntarget later on, but both way i can't get the calculation down. Did i miss something?<br>
I will try the diemix and diemixmag etc... first. Hope i can get a good result.<br>
<br>

Hi, here is my input.<br>
I am running this job in abinit 8.10.3<br>
I was using LDA psp8 for the calculation, but I think the psedopotential will not effect this error.<br>

OK, I see that you are doing more than the phonons since in your input you also calculate the non-linear responses. I guess up to dataset #4 things are running but you get the crash at one of the following dataset, could you confirm this and tell me at which dataset you have the error message?<br>
Not sure if the non-linear response is implemented with SOC, I'm going to ask to the dev of this part.<br>

Yes I got the error message for dataset 5,6,7 which is the non-linear response part.<br>
<br>
I have done a lot research and seems like the DFPT doesn't support the SOC.<br>
But for my calculation, I haven't turn on the SOC yet (nspinor).<br>
I just want to do the ferromagnetic calculation with DFPT but it won't work.<br>
It should be able to do only the spin polarized calculations without the SOC, right?(Since I was getting all the information from the tutorial. please correct me if I am wrong.)<br>
<br>
I would appreciate it if you can give me more information. <br>
