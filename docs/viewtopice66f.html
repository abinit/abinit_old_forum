				<div class="content">Hi,<br />I've just tried to upload PAW datasets for Nb to the website, following Marc's published procedure. It worked ok, except that the atomicdata folder expects for some reason the files to be named &quot;041-nb&quot; and they are named &quot;041-Nb&quot;, and I don't know how to change and/or control this. Thus all the links act like they're broken. Any suggestions?<br /><br />thanks<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">OK, it works. I guess I don't use the CMS system enough to stay in practice, but when I do use it, it sure seems cumbersome...I guess because it has so many features and tracks so many things...thanks for the help,<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Yet another upload failure. I just made PAW sets for scandium, uploaded them, but now I cannot change the name in the ATOMICDATA section to 021-Sc from 021-sc. I've retracted and issued change-name, which worked last week for Nb, but every time I try it, it comes saying that the name change failed. Any suggestions? While I'm at it, does anyone else find plone to be as big a pain in the ##%# as I do?<br /><br />thanks<br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Joe,<br /><br />sorry for that...<br /><br />But it's a feature with shared documents with all CMS<br /><br />I don't known why you tried to edit the folder &quot;021-Sc&quot;  ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW/CONTRIB/ATOMICDATA/021-Sc">http://www.abinit.org/downloads/PAW/CON ... ATA/021-Sc</a><!-- m --> ),<br />but you leave the page without &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; action !<br /><br />then, the page was locked ( see the screenshot in attachment )<br /><br />I have unlocked the page and the rename has succeeded...<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />jmb</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks, Jean-Michel! I must be just dense, I don't know why I find it so non-intuitive. In the next week or so I'll try again with a different set, maybe I'll be identify what I keep doing wrong.<br /><br />Joe</div>
