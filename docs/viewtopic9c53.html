				<h3>convergence of ecut (paw) for Lanthanum sulfides</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I'm trying to get information about pressure-induced phase-transitions (monoclinic/orthorhomb.) of lanthanum sulfides. For this task I would like to use Abinit and ELK as an comparison (as mentioned in one of the tutorials). I'm new to calculating and have several questions concerning convergence-criteria and in general.<br /><br />I have chosen Abinit to geometry-optimize structures of two phases at given cell-volumes and then use the energies to get E/V-curves for equation-of-state fitting. I read here that a faster way is to give a target-pressure and take the resulting volume after the geometry-optimization. I would further like to use the output of those runs as an input for ELK-calculations (g.opt. runs really slow with it). I played around with Abinit the last days to get familiar with it, now I have the following questions.<br /><br />1) As a „check“ of given PAW-Potentials, is it allowed to compare bandstructures of e.g. LaCl3 and Na2S calculated each with both ELK and Abinit? I would like to avoid long runs for that „potential-check“.<br />2) I skipped 1) yesterday (using PAW-files from abinit.org) and tried to get converged values of ecut, pawedgcut, and ngkpt 3*x with kptop 1. For monoclinic a_LaS2 i have reached values of ecut: 30Ha , pawedgcut 100 and ngkpt 3*3, what seems very high for me. Still I'm far away from dE=10E-6 Ha/run (that value is also set as conv.criterium for one run)<br /><br />Is it senseless to begin any discussion before doing task 1) or is it possible that Lanthanum requires really large ecutoffs that i just have not reached yet?<br /><br />Yours, Chr.</div>
