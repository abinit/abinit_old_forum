It makes life easier but it causes a lot of portability problems <br /> since some (crappy) Lapack implementations do not provide it  <br />M</div>

				<div class="content">For 1), just send me a simple program that triggers the problem and I'll add it into the build system. It will define HAVE_LINALG_ZDOTC_BUG.<br /><br />For 2), I'll add a little test that defines HAVE_LINALG_ILAVER.<br /><br />Please tell me if this is what you want.</div>

				<div class="content">It seems that  only CDOTC, CDOTU, ZDOTC, and ZDOTU are problematic <br />when Mac OS X's Vec lib is used. <br />See <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers/ve/errata.html">http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredriv ... rrata.html</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />In my branch I've introduced two new CPP flags<br />HAVE_LINALG_ZDOTC_BUG<br />HAVE_LINALG_ZDOTU_BUG<br /><br />The overloaded interface (xdotc and xdotu) will fall back <br />to a plain Fortran implementation if the functions provided<br />by the external library are problematic.<br />After this change, almost all the tests in the GW test suite passed on my mac. <br />Only wannier90_t03 failed, but I don't know if the failure is related to blas.<br /><br />I've also tried the wrappers suggested in the link above<br />but it didn't work on my mac 10.6.3<br />gfortran supports the hpf extension %val() but I got<br />an undefined reference during the lik of the clib wrappers.<br />I'm completely new to Mac OS, but I will try to understand <br />what's wrong in my environment.<br /><br />For the time being, one has to define manually the CPP flags<br />in abi_common.h. However these flags should be defined during the configuration<br />of the package. I can provide simple F90 tests if not yet done, just let me know.<br /><br />Matteo</div>

				<div class="content">Unfortunately it's not only MacOSX, but some versions of  blas/lapack  bundled with old RHEL distros are bad as well. And a _lot_ of people still have these crappy old RHE versions. Being conservative is good for stability, but not fixing bugs is borderline ridiculous.<br /><br />Great, so we have the macros set.
