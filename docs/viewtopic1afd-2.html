				<h3>_HIST file</h3>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Jordan</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />The _HIST file contains very useful data for MD simulation but lacks some information by itself.<br />Indeed, without the _OUT.nc file, there is no way to know what kind of atoms are studied and what type of atom  each atom is.<br /><br />I would like to add the ntypat, typat and znucl variables in the _HIST file as well as some other relevant variables for MD like dtion which again is in _OUT.nc rather than in _HIST.<br />Those data should be written only once at the beginning (when there are actually written in the _OUT.nc).<br /><br />Of course, those variables would remain in the _OUT.nc file.<br /><br />Do you have any objection ?<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />Jordan</div>

				<div class="content">exquisite idea. Go for it!<br /><br />The file has some overlap with the GSR and other .nc files but serves its own purpose. It is convenient, but incomplete as you mentioned.<br /><br />ciao!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Jordan,<br /><br />I've already implemented this modification in my 7.11 branch but the code must be merged by<br />Xavier in trunk. Before doing so, however, I have to remove all the calls to the etsf-io library<br />used to write the data in netcdf format since, as we agreed in Liege, Abinit8 won't rely on etsf-io anymore.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Matteo</div>

				<div class="content">Matteo, Jordan,<br /><br />I didn't look at Matteo's modifs (yes, sometimes, I don't spy!) but I suppose you have stored these time-independent data once for all in the HIST file and not at every time step...<br />Is it the case ?<br /><br />Also, if we decide to suppress the necessary use of the OUT.nc file, it is important to store in the HIST file all the quantities needed to analyse a trajectory (not only the ones you need now); for instance, the time step dtion.<br /><br />A good starting point could be APPA to list all these needed quantities; they are not numerous...<br />Looking at APPA src files, I found the following variables: natom, typat, amu, dtion, znucl<br />Could you please add these when committing your changes?<br /><br />A+<br />Marc</div>
