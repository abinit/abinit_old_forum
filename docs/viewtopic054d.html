OK, soc and magnetism problem are different things.<br>
In the latest Abinit school, Marc Torrent presented the new implementation of DFPT for non-linear response that should work for magnetism (and +U if PAW), see slide 13:<br>
<a href="http://palata.fzu.cz/abinitschool/download/Th2_DFPT.pdf" class="postlink">http://palata.fzu.cz/abinitschool/download/Th2_DFPT.pdf</a><br>
Which method did you use? (the new method might not be updated on the tuto page, let me ask).<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Eric</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Eric,<br>
I use the FULL DFPT which is the new implementation.<br>
I have read slide just after it was uploaded. That's why i use the "FULL DFPT" since it says that it can deal the magnetism system.(slide 19)<br>
and i met the problem i mentioned before.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Dear Andy,<br>
<br>
The error you see says that in the case of non-linear computations (optdriver=5) with the "FULL DFPT" method (usepead=0) the variable "occopt" should be 1 (0 should be fine too, I think).<br>
<br>
Indeed this routine has been validated only in the case of insulators. It's true that in principle one can use metallic occupations with a very small smearing to describe an insulator, but the non-linear implementation has not been checked and validated in that case yet.<br>
<br>
There is still some work to do in the non-linear implementation to make it available for more cases. We are working on it, and this specific problem will be taken into consideration. However it won't be released soon...<br>

<br>
Thanks for the info.<br>
So, seems like the magnetism system (At least ferromagnetic) with non-linear implementation is not available yet?<br>
Or is there another way to achieve the such calculation?<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Andy</div>

<br>
What I can say for sure is that the nonlinear implementation works for nspinor=1 and nsppol=1 or 2.<br>
<br>
For now Abinit doesn't provide tools to compute Raman intensities without using DFPT...<br>

<br>
Okay. Anyway, thanks for the help and the info.<br>
Hope this issue will make Abinit better.<br>
I am looking forward!<br>
<br>
I also want to mentioned that for a response function run, spinmagntarget is required to be 0.0d0 or the default value.<br>
this issue also interrupt me when I try to do the calculation for the ferromagnetic system with DFPT.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
