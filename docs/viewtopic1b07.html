The positive response to this first<br />event, also held in the &quot;Centro de Ciencias de Benasque Pedro<br />Pascual&quot;, from August 28th to September 12th 2004, encouraged the<br />organization of the sequels in the same place with an approximate<br />periodicity of two years (2006, 2008 and 2010). The purpose has in all<br />occasions been to (1) make a very intense introduction to both the<br />theory, the practice, and the numerical implementation of<br />time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT), mainly (but not<br />exclusively) oriented to young scientists willing to initiate or<br />strengthen their knowledge and skills on TDDFT, followed by (2) a<br />workshop on the subject in which all the main aspects are to be<br />covered by the leading experts. All the students of the school are<br />expected to participate in the workshop, in order to learn about the<br />state-of-the-art of the subject, after being exposed to the<br />fundamentals.<br /><br />Since TDDFT is a rapidly evolving field of Science, the precise<br />content of both school and workshop have changed over the years --<br />although the format of the events has been largely unaltered. In this<br />occasion, for example, we plan to increase our attention on the<br />implementation of the density- functional based methods on the<br />increasingly parallel (and powerful) high performance computing<br />facilities -- the step towards the so-called &quot;petascale&quot; computing.<br /><br />In all occasions there has been a very large number of applicants for<br />the school, that has increased every edition to become more than<br />150. This is not only a testimony of the strong pulse of the<br />scientific field itself, but also of the good quality of the<br />school. Since we want to maximize the learning experience of the<br />students via a close interaction with the teachers (and also due to<br />the logistic limitations imposed by the hands-on tutorial), the<br />participants of the school will not exceed 50, as it has been in<br />previous editions. The total number of participants in the full School<br />&amp; Workshop has been close to 110 in all occasions. It is worth<br />mentioning that participants came from all over the world, making this<br />series of schools and workshops a truly global event.<br /><br />The quality of the scientific work presented in the first edition<br />prompted the organizers to edit a Springer Lecture Notes book with the<br />contributions of both speakers and teachers of the workshop and the<br />school, respectively. The book was carefully edited to provide a<br />comprehensive survey of the subject (TDDFT and related methods),<br />maintaining a pedagogical style. A copy of this book was then offered<br />to all participants in the 3rd and 4th event, and served as basic<br />course material for the school. In this occasion, a new book is being<br />prepared in advance, and it will be distributed to the participants of<br />this 5th School &amp; Workshop. The need for an update of the text is due<br />to the fast evolving nature of the subject.<br /><br />*Location/Timing:*<br /><br />We plan to organize this event at the &quot;Centro de Ciencias de Benasque<br />Pedro Pascual&quot;, Benasque, Spain (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://benasque.org/">http://benasque.org/</a><!-- m -->), from January<br />4th, 2012 to January 18th, 2012. Benasque is a beautiful town in the<br />heart of the Pyrenees. The school will take place from Janary 4th (Day<br />0 - arrival of students for the school) to January 13th, and the<br />workshop will start January 13th (arrival of participants to the<br />workshop) and finish on January 18th (departure of all participants).<br /><br />*Participants:*<br /><br />The call for participation will be mainly directed to students and<br />scientists specialized on computational physics, quantum chemistry and<br />biophysics. We will limit the number of students to the school to 40<br />and participants to the workshop to less than 100, in order to ensure<br />a maximum interaction between all the scientists<br />participating. Attendance of graduate students and post-docs will be<br />strongly encouraged through the inclusion of short contributed talks<br />and a poster session. Furthermore, we will award to PhD students who<br />present an outstanding poster short oral presentations.<br /><br />*Applications/Support:*<br />--------------------<br /><br />All persons who wish to participate should fill out the application<br />form at:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://benasque.org/2012tddft/">http://benasque.org/2012tddft/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />In the comments section, please indicate if you wish to participate in<br />the Summer Summer School or in the Workshop (or in both).<br /><br />School only:<br /><br />As we have a very limited number of places for the school, students<br />will be selected from among an open pool of applicants who have<br />demonstrated a strong interest in computational sciences, applied to<br />chemistry, physics, materials science and biology. Therefore, in order<br />that we can make a reasonable selection, we ask that *all* candidates<br />include in the comments section the following information:<br /><br />*) Date of birth, gender<br />*) Motivation/Why they want to come (just a couple of lines is enough)<br />*) What is their current and previous positions (if PhD or Post-doc<br />    state your supervisor).<br /><br />We will *not* accept applications that do not include this<br />information. Furthermore, we will give priority to students willing to<br />participate in both the Summer School and the Workshop.<br /><br />We also have a certain number of grants available that cover traveling<br />and part of the stay in Benasque. If you want to apply for a grant,<br />please indicate explicitly that you wish to be supported in the<br />comments section, and explain why (just a couple of lines is enough).<br /><br />For participants coming from the USA, please check the following<br />address for support:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mcc.uiuc.edu/">http://www.mcc.uiuc.edu/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Tentative program for the School:<br /><br />The school will be attended by a maximum of around 50 students, and<br />will last 9 days, with theoretical sessions (mostly) in the mornings<br />and practical (tutorial) sessions in the afternoons. The theoretical<br />sessions will consist of four 45m lectures (including discussions) per<br />day. The practical sessions will last for 3 hours per day and a<br />computer will be allocated for every two students. This will allow the<br />students to have some time every day for studying and talking to the<br />teachers. The program of the school starts with basic TDDFT, then<br />continues with more complex theoretical and numerical aspects of<br />TDDFT, and ends with an outline of some of its many<br />applications. Basic knowledge on ground state DFT calculations is<br />required. Also during the school we will address other approaches to<br />describe excited state properties based on either man y-body<br />perturbation theory or quantum-chemistry schemes.<br /><br />The preliminary program is:<br /><br />04/01     a:    Registration<br /><br />05/01     m:    TDDFT (2 x 45m, T)<br />                       Overview of spectroscopies (45m, T)<br />                       Many-Body - GW (45m, T)<br />                a:    Introduction to the practical classes<br />                       Introduction to the codes<br /><br />06/01     m:    Overview of spectroscopies (45m, T)<br />                       TDDFT (45m, T)<br />                       Many-Body - GW (45m, T)<br />                       Many-Body - BSE (45m, T)<br />                a:    Basic TDDFT code I (3h, P)<br /><br />07/01     m:    TDDFT (45m, T)<br />                       Overview of spectroscopies (45m, T)<br />                       Propagation schemes (45m, T)<br />                       Many-Body - BSE (45m, T)<br />                a:    Basic TDDFT code II (3h, P)<br /><br />08/01     m:    Advanced TDDFT (45m, T)<br />                       Models for time-dependent phenomena (45m, T)<br />                       Overview of spectroscopies (45m, T)<br />                       TDDFT as a tool in chemistry (45m, T)<br />                a:    Basic TDDFT code III (3h, T)<br /><br />09/01     Free day<br /><br />10/01     m:    TDDFT as a tool in chemistry (45m, T)<br />                       Models for time-dependent phenomena (45m, T)<br />                       Advanced TDDFT (45m, T)<br />                       Current DFT (45m, T)<br />                a:    OCTOPUS I (3h, P)<br />                       POSTER SESSION<br /><br />11/01     m:    TDDFT as a tool in chemistry (45m, T)<br />                       Optimal control theory (45m, T)<br />                       Current DFT (45m, T)<br />                       Models for time-dependent phenomena (45m, T)<br />                a:    OCTOPUS II (3h, P)<br />                       POSTER SESSION<br /><br />12/01     m:    TDDFT vs. Many-Body (45m, T)<br />                       TDDFT as a tool in chemistry (45m, T)<br />                       TDDFT as a tool in biophysics (45m, T)<br />                       Advanced TDDFT (45m, T)<br />                a:    YAMBO I (3h, P)<br />                       POSTER SESSION<br /><br />13/01     m:    TDDFT vs. Many-Body (45m, T)<br />                       Models for time-dependent phenomena (45m, T)<br />                       TDDFT as a tool in biophysics (45m, T)<br />                       Current DFT (45m, T)<br />                a:    YAMBO II (3h, P)<br />                       Final Remarks<br />                       Talks on Popular Science<br /><br /><br />*Tentative program for the Workshop:*<br /><br />The 4 day workshop will start January 14, 2010 in the afternoon and<br />will end January 18 in the morning. It will include both invited talks<br />on key aspects of TDDFT (45m each), contributed talks (30m) and a<br />poster session. The topics will include:<br /><br />* Foundations of TDDFT, new developments and challenges<br /><br />* Experimental challenges<br /><br />* TD-DMFT, optimal control theory and strong laser fields.<br /><br />* Excited state dynamics and chemical reactivity<br /><br />* Molecular Transport, open quantum systems<br /><br />* Applications: nanotubes, quantum dots, nanostructures, solids and surfaces<br /><br />* Biological applications<br /><br />* Computational: Towards Thousands of Atoms<br /><br />The updated program with the list of speakers, both for the School and<br />the Workshop, will be posted in the web page<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://benasque.org/2012tddft/">http://benasque.org/2012tddft/</a><!-- m -->.<br /><br />Speakers will be encouraged to present their talks in an informal<br />style, allowing time for discussion. Also, they will be encouraged to<br />be pedagogical during the first half of the talk, due the mixed<br />character of the audience. The time for each talk will be divided into<br />75% for the presentation plus 25% discussion. The characteristics of<br />the location encourage the scientific discussion beyond the allocated<br />time for the talks: there is ample office space and discussion<br />rooms. In our previous experiences, this fact has contributed<br />considerably to the success of the event.<br /><br />===========================================================================<br />Dr. Angel Rubio<br /><br />NanoBio Spectroscopy Group and ETSF Scientific Development Centre<br />Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Chemistry<br />University of the Basque Country  UPV/EHU<br />Centro Joxe Mari Korta, Avenida de Tolosa, 72,<br />E-20018 Donostia-San Sebastian, Spain<br /><br />Tel. : + 34 943 01 8292 (CSIC 8818)   Fax  : + 34 943 01 8390<br />Tel. : + 34 943 01 8534 (Manager)<br />skype: angel_rubio<br />email:Angel.Rubio@ehu.es              web:http://nano-bio.ehu.es/<br /><br />Fritz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft<br />Faradayweg 4-6  D-14195 Berlin-Dahlem / Germany<br />Phone: + 49 30 8413 4824<br />===========================================================================</div>
