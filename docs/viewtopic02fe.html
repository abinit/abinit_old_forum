				<div class="content">Abinit is an open source software developed and maintained by many people in many countries for their activities. We generously share our work with the community.<br />If nobody answers your questions this might be because nobody reading the forum has the answer or maybe because you are being rude.<br /><br />You may also want to think more than 1s before posting a question. Just saying &quot;it does not work&quot; won't help us to help you ! You should also demonstrate that you've  searched a solution or that you've at least investigated the problem -- which is not the case btw.<br /><br />If you are not satisfied with this forum  you can try to find another one that fits your need.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Jordan</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Why no one helping out?? what is the use of this forum if I post many questions and barely get answers????</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is being rude to me or at least not very kind. We are not a paid technical support. Don't expect us to be one and to answer all the questions in this forum. <br />The implementation of a feature could have been done by a developer who is not reading this forum and thus nobody can provide help on his /her code.<br />There are more than 40 developers who first do research, then develop and if time allows it, help others on this forum.<br /><br />As I said, when you ask a question, provide as many information as you can by providing the input file, the output file/log file PLUS all the tests/tries you did which did not solve the problem.<br />As abinit is an opensource code, you can still look up in the src files where your error/warning/comment message appears using the &quot;grep&quot; command and try to figure out what is going on.<br />We won't do your work as you won't do ours. The more you do, the faster you have an answer. And be patient.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>
