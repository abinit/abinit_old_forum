				<div class="content">Dear ALL:<br /><br />      Recently when trying to do Abinit calculation, there is always a problem of Memory: <br /><br />memana : ERROR -<br />  Test failed to allocate   4285.261 Mbytes<br /><br />     Then in order to overcome this, I even bought 32Gb (4*8Gb) memory... <br /><br />     However, it still does not work, even 4 cores need 4285*4 &lt;&lt;32Gb. <br /><br />    Therefore, I was wondering, is this because the Abinit I installed is NOT a parallel version, which is 32bit and cannot understand memory &gt;4Gb? <br /><br />    Thank you very much for any kind of help and suggestions.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>
