				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />I'm using abinit 6.2.3.<br /><br />I have a problem with the integrated density of states in the<br />DOS output file (prtdos 2). The top of the DOS output file gives<br />the fermi energy, but the integrated DOS value at that fermi<br />energy is not equal to the total number of electrons in the cell.<br /><br />I have been using &quot;GGA.fhi&quot; pseudo potentials.<br />Also I tried a spin-polarized calculation, but with the same result.<br /><br />Shouldn't the integrated DOS at the fermi energy be equal to<br />the total number of valence electrons in the system?<br />(I mean: in the unit cell each Na contributes 1 electron,<br />each O 6 electrons, each C  4 electrons etc.).<br /><br />Why is there a discrepancy of a few electrons between the<br />integrated DOS at the fermi level, and the total number of<br />treated electrons in the cell?<br /><br />Is the calculation of the fermi energy incorrect?<br />Or am I doing something completely wrong here?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Rob.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Rob,<br /><br />Can you send more information please? Your input and which pseudopotential you used would be helpful.<br /><br />Is the discrepancy significant? If it is an integer, it probably means that your pseudopotential have more (or less) core electrons than you thought. <br /><br />Also, the option for band occupation (occopt) might influence the determination of the Fermi level. If you used occopt=1 for a metal, you will have a problem.<br /><br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you for your reply.<br /><br />I have done an example calculation here:<br /><a href="http://skku.homeip.net/lahaye/abinit/NumberOfElectrons/" class="postlink">http://skku.homeip.net/lahaye/abinit/NumberOfElectrons/</a><br />which hopefully demonstrates my issue.<br /><br />This is NaTaO3, but I use 8 unit cells in my supercell and replace one oxygen<br />atom a by C atom, to simulate a kind of doping effect.<br />Hence, I have a supercell with 40 atoms: 8 x Na, 8 x Ta, 23 x O, 1 x C.<br /><br />From the &quot;fhi&quot; pseudo potentials I can see:<br />Na has 1 valence electron, Ta has 5 electrons, O has 6 el., and C has 4 el.<br />Therefore, in my supercell I should have 8x1 + 8x5 + 23x6 + 1x4 = 190 electrons.<br /><br />Now I want to highlight the troublesome excepts of the DOS output file nofo_DOS:<br /><br /># nsppol = 2, nkpt =   75, nband(1)= 130<br /># Tetrahedron method<br /># For identification : eigen(1:3)=  -0.872  -0.867  -0.866<br />#<br /># Fermi energy :       0.02039816<br />#<br />[...snip.....From Spin-up DOS:...]<br />  1839    0.01950   28.6539   95.9629<br />  1840    0.02000   31.8590   95.9805<br />  1841    0.02050    0.1147   96.0000<br />  1842    0.02100    0.1125   96.0000<br />[...snip.....From spin-dn DOS:...]<br />  1839    0.01950   28.6539   95.9629<br />  1840    0.02000   31.8590   95.9805<br />  1841    0.02050    0.1147   96.0000<br />  1842    0.02100    0.1125   96.0000<br />[...snip...]<br /><br />I have done a spin polarized calculation and for both, Spin-up and Spin-dn,<br />I find 96 electrons around the indicated fermi level, that is 192 electrons.<br /><br />Why does this DOS calculation have 192 electrons, whereas there should<br />be only 190 electrons ???<br /><br />Am I doing something wrong, or am I misinterpreting the DOS data file?<br />Help is much appreciated.<br />Thank you!<br /><br />Rob.</div>

				<div class="content">The problem probably comes from the option for the occupation. Since you have a metal (DOS not 0 at E_F), you should use occopt=7.<br />See:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.2/input_variables/varbas.html#occopt">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/hel ... tml#occopt</a><!-- m --><br /><br />This will probably solve your problem. Your ecut is also pretty low, but I assume who knew that.<br /><br />Good luck,<br /><br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">ok, thanks for the very complete details and files. Your occupations and output seem to indicate 95 bands occupied, whereas the DOS goes to a different number of electrons at the Fermi energy (note: your files are different from the example you cite in the post - don't know where your 0.02039816 comes from)<br /><br />Try with prtdos 1 for a reference (you can rerun from the same WFK) - in some cases the tetrahedron method has issues if 3 or 4 k-points at the vertices of a tetrahedron are degenerate in energy (usually for very sparse or very symmetric grids). This should be dealt with cleanly, however - I have never seen any problems.<br /><br />Did you set &quot;charge&quot; at any point? This would explain the added electron if the WF come from a charged run and are reused for the DOS, or something like that...<br /><br />keep looking... Apart from the DOS did you see any other signs of charge non-conservation?<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
