				<div class="content">Bonjour<br /><br />I would like to do following: generate an abo_WFK file with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order but without any AFM-symmetry elements (no symafm elements).<br /><br />The AFM order is in some cases to obtain spontaneously therefore I generate first a afmo_WFK file where the AFM order is imposed (nsppol 1, nspden).  However, I converge the calculation well (tolvrs 10d-8). Afterwards I would like to start from that file without imposing the AFM order (nsppol 2, irdwfk 1).<br /><br />I observe following: abinit reads afmo_WFK file correctly (e.g. the occupations at the first step  are identical to the afm run to a precision of 10d-6). But abinit &quot;does not realize&quot; that the wavefunction is already converged and thus performs optimizations steps which strongly perturb the system  and destroy the AFM order (here at least the high spin state). Furthermore a state with a much higher energy is<br />found. Why?<br /><br />If I impose in the second run the occupation matrix of the AFM, I can recover the AFM state. This indicates that the AFM is at least a local minimum of the magnetic states. It should not be destroyed in a follow-up run!<br /><br />Usually it works well to converge the WFK and read it in a run with less symmetry elements. But for the transition from AFM to magnetic it does not. Is there a bug in the code?<br /><br />With my best regards, Donat</div>
