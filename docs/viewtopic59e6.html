				<div class="content">Hi, I want to do lattice wannierization of my phonon calculation results. Though this functionality had been removed in version 8, I found that a source file lwf.F90 exists in version abinit-7.6.4!  However, the problem is that I cannot find any proper tutorials or manuals related to lattice wannier functions in abinit.<br /> <br />Is there anyone who is familiar with lattice wannier functions and who can explain to me how to use this? It would be extremely helpful for me.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear cwmyung,<br />This peace of code was not implemented completely and it has not been maintained afterward such that it has been removed.<br />I have a postdoc working on these LWF but this is still at the dev side, please contact me by email if you want to know more about it.<br />Best wishes,<br />Eric</div>
