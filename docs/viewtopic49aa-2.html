				<div class="content">Hiï¼Œ<br />I want to calculate the bond energy, followed the tutorial, I should set the variables of occ occopt and nband. I have set that :<br />nsppol 2<br />occopt 2<br />nband 4 4<br />ntypat 1<br />znucl 7<br />typat 1 1<br />kptopt 0<br />nkpt 1<br />but I donot know how to set the occ and wtk, and I have read the basic input variables lst and description in the help files, however<br />I donot understand very well. I am a new in abinit, can someone explain to me how to set these parameters? Thanks a lot!</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />The wtk is the weight of each k-point. In your case, you only have the gamma point and the weight is 1. Note that in case of solids with more k-points, you can use the automatic generation of k-point sets with kptopt 1 and the ngkpt/kptrlatt and nshiftk+shiftk variables.<br /><br />The occ variable is the occupation of each band at each k-point. This depends on your system of course. For hydrogen for example the molecular H2 has 2 electrons and you will have the occ like this (with your nband 4 4) :<br />occ 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0<br /><br />... meaning that the first band of the first k-point for spin down is occupied with one electron, the next three are empty and the same applies for spin up. Note also that the occupancies (occ) can also be set automatically by abinit using occopt 1 for a semiconductor and occopt 3 to occopt 7 for a metallic system.<br /><br />Hopes it helps,<br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">Dear David :<br />I have read your reply, and I  change the input file, but it also has problems. This is my whole input file and on the bottom are some of my understanding. I hope you can correct me the wrong place.

And spin-up electrons with spin-down electrons  should be equal to  the total number of electrons  7. <br />Above, it is my understand. But after running ,it has a error:<br /> <span style="color: #FF0000">ERROR - These must obey zval-nelect_occ=charge to better than 0.10E-07<br /> This is not the case.<br />   Action : check input file for occ,wtk, and charge.<br />   Note that wtk is NOT automatically normalized when occopt=2,<br />   but IS automatically normalized otherwise.</span><br /><br />Please give guidance, thanks~</div>
