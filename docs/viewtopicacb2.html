				<h3>Wrong DOS plot of graphene</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sat Aug 01, 2015 11:08 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Dear Abinit Users<br /> <br />I have been trying for a while to obtain the density of states plot of graphene.<br />I have done the ecut and ngkpt convergence, then the optimization of atomic geometry of graphene and then tried to do density of states calculation using tetrahedron method.<br />I am facing a great problem that as per the theory the dos of graphene is zero at zero energy. But I am getting a different plot where the density of states is showing zero values away from the zero energy level. The input file, the dos plot and the output file are attached herewith.<br /><br />Is it necessary that ngkpt grid should contain the high symmetry points of the Briolluin zone, how can I make sure that the grid contains these points. Is it the reason for the wrong result that I obtain.<br /><br />Please guide me in this regard.<br /><br />For my last two posts, I didnt receive a reply from anyone.<br /><br />Please help me with some comments so that I could continue.<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br />Seba</div>

Does calculations in parallel can result in wrong results?<br /><br />Hope to hear from you favourably<br />Thanks and Regards<br />Seba</div>

				<div class="content">Two points:<br /><br />1) Do DOS calculation in serial mode. I got wrong results previously using parallel mode, and if you browse through the forum you can also find people reporting about inconsistencies in its intensity.<br /><br />2) Your fermi energy is -0.03430 Hartree. In your graph above did you shift your fermi energy to zero? From visual inspection, the DOS at fermi energy level is indeed zero.</div>
