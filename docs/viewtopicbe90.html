				<div class="content">Hi,<br />well, yet again I have uploaded PAW data sets to the web site and yet again I cannot get the site to show them all. I succeeded in changing the name on the 031-Ga set from 031-ga (the default, lower-case) to 031-Ga (upper-case, as used by the periodic table graphic) but I cannot get the system to accept my change of 033-as to 033-As. Why exactly does this have to be so hard? Couldn't at least the default name correspond to what the periodic table graphic uses as url links? then I wouldn't have to go through this name changing stuff every time I upload a PAW set. <br />Joe</div>
