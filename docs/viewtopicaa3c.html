				<div class="content">hi,everyone!<br />i have read all of the topics of parallel setting in this forum,but i am still confused.<br />for gs calculation, abinit can parallel on three levels which are k-point, G-vector and band. <br />The corresponding parameters are npkpt, npfft and npband, respectively.<br /> in order to understand how to sett parameters, i have done several calculations.<br />Experiment 1:<br />                 A small system , with only one atom (Fe) in the primitive cell. in fact, it's the example of spin in abinit official tutorial. <br />i changed the k-point setting, and used  a  bigger one (14*14*14).<br />                   first, i did the calculation with paral_kgb=0,which is default setting by abinit. The Overwall time is 315.2 sec. <br />                   second, i opened parallel on kgb.(npkpt=npfft=1.npband=5). The Overwall time is 644.6 sec.<br />          abinit version is 6.8.1, the computer is small dell workstation with 2 xeon( 8 processors). I had just used 5 processors in experiment 1.<br />Experiment 2:<br />                  a bigger system with 17 atoms( 16 fe and one N),and k-point setting is 2*2*2.<br />                    first, i did the calculation with paral_kgb=0,which is default setting by abinit. The Overwall time is 31122 sec.  <br />                   second, i opened parallel on kgb.(npkpt=npfft=1.npband=8). The Overwall time is 13424 sec.<br />            abinit version is also 6.8.1 and the computer is the same with Exp.1. This time ,used 8 processors.<br />compare Exp. 1 with 2, i get the result : for system with larger k-point grid , it is better to parallel on k-point (which is default of abinit). for system with a lot of atoms, the band is the main factor, it is better to parallel on band.<br />             i also have done several calculations in order to understand  npfft, but  got no idea about it until now .<br />I want to ask following questions.<br />         a. Do i have got the correct result about npkpt and npband setting?<br />         b. Can someone tell me how to tune npfft?<br />         c. For a system, we know the atoms number, the band number and k-point grid., how to tune npkpt, npband and npfft to get the optimal setting?<br /><br />  think you for your time!<br />                                        hhwj</div>
