				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />I have been trying for days to get a converged solution of an isolated chromium atom, but no luck here. Maybe I'm doing something wrong with the input. My final approach was to use a spin-polarized calculation using the occupations below to get the 3d^5, 4s^1 configuration (see options below). When trying nsppol=1 for anti-ferromagnetic calculations, abinit keeps complaining about missing (a)symmetry to differentiate between spin-up / spin-down states. I'm using the FHI pseudopotentials together with LDA/LDS (ixc=7).<br /><br />nsppol 2<br />occopt 2<br />nband 3 3<br />occ 5 1 0 0 0 0<br />spinat 0.0 0.0 3.0<br /><br />The total energy jumps between -8.2 and -9.5 Ha, even after about 70 SCF iterations. What can I do about this?<br /><br />Many thanks,<br />Oliver</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />The code probably oscillates between two solutions, a magnetic and non-magnetic one with different energies. You should be able to confirm this by looking at your log. <br /><br />You could probably solve this problem by imposing a density matrix as explained in the LDA+U tutorial (you can set U to zero).<br /> <br />If you are only calculating for an isolated Cr atom, then an anti-ferromagnetic calculation is impossible as you need at least two atoms to make it work (one spin up, one spin down).<br /><br />Good luck<br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Simon,<br /><br />thank you for the fast reply! Of course, I will immediately counter this with another question  <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> (actually, shame on me, but I'm a very novice in DFT still...)<br /><br />The LDA+U tutorial shows application together with the PAW technique. Is this mandatory? (PAW data for chromium is rather rare, while HGH and FHI pseudopotentials are readily available).<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Oliver</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Oliver,<br /><br />DFT+U is available only in conjunction with PAW atomic datasets and not with Norm Conserving Pseudopotentials.<br />As underlined my Simon, you could impose the density matrix to help the convergency, but in order to be efficient, you need to use a non zero value of U<br />(with U=0, the imposition will have no effects).<br /><br />Alternatively, and firstly,  you might retry with value of &quot;occ&quot; between 0 and 1, see for example test v5/14.<br /><br />Good Luck<br />Bernard</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Bernard,<br /><br />thanks for the info! As I would rather stay with the more tested PsPs instead of the rare PAW data for chromium, I will try it with the occ numbers as you suggested first!<br /><br />Btw: is there any option in Abinit to keep the magnetization fixed such that only one of the solutions will be aimed at during SCF cycles?<br /><br />Yours,<br />Oliver</div>
