				<h3>[Solved] Parallelism of multi-datasets</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello All:<br /><br />      There is a peculiar problem, that whenever I use multidataset mode (ndtset &gt;1) in parallel abinit (mpirun), it reports problem in the log file:<br /><br /> MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD with errorcode 14.<br /><br />NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes. You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on exactly when Open MPI kills them.<br /><br />On the other hand,<br />1) the .in file and .files file are good, since I can run them in serial with multi-datasets.<br />2) the mpi seems good, too, since without multi-dataset mode, it can run in mpi. <br /><br /><br />The log file tells more information: <br />MPI_ERROR_STRING: MPI_ERR_UNKNOWN: unknown error<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />mpirun has exited due to process rank 0 with PID 24963 on<br />node node7 exiting improperly. There are two reasons this could occur:<br /><br />1. this process did not call &quot;init&quot; before exiting, but others in the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits for all processes to call &quot;init&quot;. By rule, if one process calls &quot;init&quot;, then ALL processes must call &quot;init&quot; prior to termination.<br /><br />2. this process called &quot;init&quot;, but exited without calling &quot;finalize&quot;. By rule, all processes that call &quot;init&quot; MUST call &quot;finalize&quot; prior to exiting or it will be considered an &quot;abnormal termination&quot;. This may have caused other processes in the application to be terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).<br /><br /><br />The information only says to call &quot;init&quot;, but does not tell how to call it. I tried to look up the answer but still don't get it.<br /><br /> Could anyone shed some light on this problem? It is really frustrating. Thank you in advance.</div>

				<div class="content">In this issue, I may have to reconcile the problem with the number of datasets are greater than the number of cpus... It might be due to the different configuration procedure in compiling abinit.</div>
