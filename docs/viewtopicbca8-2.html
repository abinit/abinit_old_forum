				<div class="content">When learing Abinit through the tutorial of &quot;PAW3&quot;, I find a paragraph includes the following words,<br /><br />&quot;If you need to perform calculations which involve the Fock operator or unoccupied states - like in GW calculations for instance - you will probably need at least three projectors. You might also want to add extra projectors in completely unoccupied l-channels&quot;<br /><br />Could anyone told me more details about why 3-projector is essential. Whether the result reliable if I calculate GW correction with a 2-projector PAW?<br /><br />Since I have tried to construct 3-projecotr by AtomPAW for Ti, but failed  because I couldn't find a group of energy for all the projectors that cause no ghost states meanwhile. How to constucture a well performed PAW?<br /><br />Another problem is how can I interpolate GW calculation for full band structure? I searched the fourm and find the script &quot;ab_extended_scissors_guess.py&quot; may works, but I don't have *.nc or .GW after the calculation finished. (Abinit version 8.0)</div>
