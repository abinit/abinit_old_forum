				<div class="content">Hi,<br />I am not sure but it seems to me that there is a mistake in the derivative of the bessel function during the settlement of the kleinman-bylander projector of the pseudopotential, in the file 65_psp/psp5nl.F90.<br />The mistake would be at the lines :<br />316<br />396<br />473<br />The derivative of the Bessel function should be :  <br />           $dj_n(qr)/dx = 2\pi r [ j_{n-1}(2\pi q r) - \frac{n}{2\pi q r} j_n(2\pi q r) dr]$<br />whereas the following formula is used :<br />           $dj_n(qr)/dx = 2\pi r [ j_{n-1}(2\pi q r) - \frac{n+1}{2\pi q r} j_n(2\pi q r) dr]$<br />n+1 is used instead of n in the fraction.<br /><br />Also lignes 300 and 303, I don't understand the division by 3.0?<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your answer<br />Best Regards<br />PYP</div>

				<div class="content">ok sorry, this is my mistake, the spline doesn't involve the first but the second derivative.<br />Sorry again for this message<br />PYP</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for my second post, this is what happen when making several things at a time. But finally I am still thinking that my first post is right, <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ppy wrote:</cite>The derivative of the Bessel function should be :<br />$dj_n(qr)/dx = 2\pi r [ j_{n-1}(2\pi q r) - \frac{n}{2\pi q r} j_n(2\pi q r) dr]$<br />whereas the following formula is used :<br />$dj_n(qr)/dx = 2\pi r [ j_{n-1}(2\pi q r) - \frac{n+1}{2\pi q r} j_n(2\pi q r) dr]$<br />n+1 is used instead of n in the fraction.</div></blockquote><br /><br />so maybe somebody would have some suggestions...<br /><br />Thanks for your answers</div>

				<div class="content">Hello, <br /><br />could you supply a patch file with some context lines around the ones you think are wrong? The line numbers change all the time so I don't know which ones you are looking at.<br /><br />How did you come upon this? Do you have an erroneous result or some failing test of your own?<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your answer, I understood MY mistake, I was using the Bessel function of the first kind instead of the spherical ones.<br />To answer your question I am trying to implement a pseudo empirical code, and I am trying to calculate the Kleinman-Bylander form of the pseudopotential, since I am a fortunate user of Abinit and I like this code, I am checking step by step if what I am doing is fine and my understanding fairly well. This proves that it was necessary.<br />Best Regards!<br />PYP</div>

				<div class="content">So the formulas in psp5nl are fine? <br /><br />If you are looking for a pseudopotential code, the bits of abinit are quite limited. You could look at fhi98pp, APE, or OPIUM for more complete codes with all of the trappings.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I think every thing is fine is the routine pspnl.f90.<br />Thanks for the advice, actually I am also looking at the fhi98pp code in the same time, but I probably did it too fast and I didn't notice my mistake.<br />Best Regards</div>
