				<div class="content">Are you familiar with the concept of Wyckoff positions?<br />You can get the Wyckoff positions for every space group from the Bilbao Crystallographic Server.<br /><br />Read the input variables descriptions for spgroup, natrd and brvltt.<br /><br />natrd refers to the minimum number of site symmetries in your structure.<br />xred in case should be only the minimum number of Wyckoff position needed to construct your structure.</div>

				<div class="content">so as far as I can tell I should set brvltt=1 since this constructs the primitive cell from the space group. <br />Also I should set spgroup 186 of course.<br />About natrd I am not sure. You say natrd is the minimum number of site symmetries for space group 186 - how do I find this? I have plugged in spgroup 186 in the tool for calculating the wyckoff positions on the Bilbao crystallographic server and it gave me this: <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/programs/nph-wp-list">http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/p ... ph-wp-list</a><!-- m --><br />It is a different positions labeled by letters a-d but then they have different multiplicities, which amounts to many different points in the coordinate system (x,y,z). What numbers should I put for the actual Wyckoff positions?</div>

				<div class="content">Okay as far as I can tell the wyckoff positions of the atomic positions:<br />2/3  1/3  3/8  <br />1/3  2/3  7/8  <br />2/3  1/3  0<br />1/3  2/3  1/2<br />Are all generated by the wyckoff positions 2b.

I guess this is taken care of by the space group?

				<div class="content">Correct.<br /><br />You just need to input the Wyckoff positions in xred, and Abinit will generate all available mirror images.<br />So in your case just provide two coordinates for xred.<br />You don't need to mention the site symmetries 2b, Abinit will identify them according to the atomic coordinates you input.<br /><br />In short<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>spgroup 186<br />natom 4<br />natrd 2<br />typat 1 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />xred&nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; 1/3&nbsp; 3/8&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; 1/3&nbsp; 0<br /></code></pre></div><br />The rest should be same as your original input file.<br /><br />At the first try you should be generate the full conventional space group structure to ensure you got the correct coordinates for all the atoms (check the log file at mid-calculation). Then stop the calculation and only then let Abinit generate primitive structure by using the variable brvltt=-1</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />This is what one can find on abinit input variables part of the web<br /><br />Alternatively to rprim, directions of dimensionless primitive vectors can be specified by using the input variable angdeg. This is especially useful for hexagonal lattices (with 120 or 60 degrees angles). Indeed, in order for symmetries to be recognized, rprim must be symmetric up to tolsym(10 digits by default), inducing a specification such as<br /><br />rprim  0.86602540378  0.5  0.0<br />      -0.86602540378  0.5  0.0<br />       0.0            0.0  1.0<br /><br />that can be avoided thanks to angdeg:<br /><br />angdeg 90 90 120<br /><br /><br />Now you can see why abinit exited with an error. Try with angdeg, and use the appropriate k-grid shift<br /><br />4) For hexagonal lattices with hexagonal axes, e.g. rprim<br /><br />        1.0  0.0       0.0<br />       -0.5  sqrt(3)/2 0.0<br />        0.0  0.0       1.0<br />one can use nshiftk= 1 and shiftk 0.0 0.0 0.5<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Igor L.</div>

				<div class="content">I think it is working now - thanks to both of you.<br />What however troubles is how the band structure plot looks. I have attached it below on, and as you can see it seems to have some sharp edges. At first I thought it was because I chose the wrong symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, but I have now changed these to those for wurtzite (A, K and Gamma) and the band structure still looks weird. I am not sure whether it has anything to do with how abinit creates the k-space grid. Can someone explain to me how this works exactly? I have tried to read the documentation for nshiftk and kshift but it doesn't make complete sense to me. In my case where nshifkt is 1 and shiftk is 0 0 0.5 (or I think I changed it to 0 0 0, which however made no difference), how does the assembling of the k-space grid work? <br />I have attached my band structure code below, so you may see whether I did something wrong in that:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>#Bulk GaAs wurtzite <br />#<br /># Computation of the band structure.<br /># First, a SCF density computation, then a non-SCF band structure calculation.<br /><br />ndtset 2<br /><br />#Dataset 1 : usual self-consistent calculation<br />kptopt1 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Option for the automatic generation of k points,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# taking into account the symmetry<br />nshiftk1 1<br />shiftk1&nbsp; 0.0 0.0 0.0&nbsp; # These shifts will be the same for all grids<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # 0.5 0.0 0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # 0.0 0.5 0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # 0.0 0.0 0.5<br />ngkpt1&nbsp; 4 4 4&nbsp; <br />prtden1&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Print the density, for use by dataset 2<br />toldfe1&nbsp; 1.0d-6&nbsp; &nbsp; # This value is way too large for most realistic studies of materials<br /><br />#Dataset 2 : the band structure<br />iscf2&nbsp; &nbsp; -2<br />getden2&nbsp; -1<br />kptopt2&nbsp; -3<br />nband2&nbsp; &nbsp;8<br />ndivk2&nbsp; &nbsp;10 12 17&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # 10, 12 and 17 divisions of the 3 segments, delimited<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# by 4 points.<br />kptbounds2&nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; 0.5 # A point<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; 0.0 # Gamma point<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; 1/3&nbsp; 0 # K point<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.0&nbsp; 1.0&nbsp; 1.0 # Gamma point in another cell.<br />tolwfr2&nbsp; 1.0d-12<br />enunit2&nbsp; 1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Will output the eigenenergies in eV <br /><br /><br />#Definition of the unit cell for GaAs wurtzite<br />acell 7.39250 7.39250 12.07190<br />angdeg 90. 90. 120.<br />#rprim&nbsp; 0.5&nbsp; &nbsp; -0.86602540378&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.86602540378&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; 0.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.0<br />spgroup 186<br /><br /><br />#Definition of the atom types<br />ntypat 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # There is only one type of atom<br />znucl 33 31&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />#Definition of the atoms<br />natom 4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# There are four atoms in the unit cell<br />natrd 2<br />typat 1 2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />xred&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # will follow, one triplet of number for each atom<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2/3&nbsp; 1/3&nbsp; 3/8&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;#1/3&nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; 7/8&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;2/3&nbsp; 1/3&nbsp; 0.0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;#1/3&nbsp; 2/3&nbsp; 1/2<br /><br />#Definition of the planewave basis set<br />ecut 60.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree<br /><br />#Definition of the SCF procedure<br />nstep 10&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # Maximal number of SCF cycles<br />diemac 12.0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # precondition the SCF cycle.

				<div class="content">I might have used the wrong lattice parameters for GaAs. This plot shows the band structure for the correct lattice parameters and with 50 instead of 10 SFC cycles. It seems the problem does not converge and the band structure end up looking like this. Does anyone have an idea of what might be wrong? The brillion zone points are not on this plot but are the same as before.</div>

				<div class="content">If you think the edges are too sharp, then you should try to increase ndivk to values more like 100, or juste use ndivsm 100 (read documentation for the difference between ndivk and ndivsm)<br />Also, note that the &quot;bands&quot; are always sorted. Therefore if two bands cross each other and you don't have enough points, you will seen a very sharp change of the energy like your red and cyan curves between K and G on your first plot.<br /><br />Jordan</div>

				<div class="content">okay but what can I do if the problem wont seem to converge? I ran 50 SFC cycles for the last plot and it seemed to not to converge. The lattice parameter I used for GaAs was one found in litterature. Should I determine it from a convergence study?</div>

				<div class="content">I think the problem was that I was using the wrong lattice parameter. I have now found the optimal lattice parameter for GaAs wurtzite and got the following band structure plot. Does this look realistic?</div>

				<div class="content">I have now managed to generate the band structure for InAs, which was the end goal. However it seems that the wavefunctions do not converge and I end up with the plot below with alot of fringes in the band structure.<br />I have made a convergence study with respect to the lattice parameter so I am not sure, what causes the problem not to converge? Which parameters can I change that will affect convergence?</div>

				<div class="content">The last wavefunctions often do not converge. <br />Therefore you should set nband to a larger value than the number of bands you want and use nbdbuf to ignore those last band when checking if the residus are converged or not.<br />And of course, just plot the converged bands.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to use large values of nline and nnsclo (at least 10 10)<br /><br />Jordan</div>

				<div class="content">Dear shalom,<br /><br />As everyone else who started using abinit, you should first and foremost read the abinit specific documentation available on the web site. After that, before starting to calculate your system(s), you should go through the first 4 tutorials (more if you have time). There you will find most of your initial questions answered.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Igor</div>
