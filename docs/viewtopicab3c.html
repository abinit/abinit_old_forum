				<div class="content">During the geometry optimisation, the following WARNING appears frequently:<br /><br />--- !WARNING<br />src_file: mkdenpos.F90<br />src_line: 176<br />message: |<br />    Density went too small (lower than xc_denpos) at 130203 points<br />    and was set to xc_denpos =   1.00E-14. Lowest was  -0.64E-04.<br />    Likely due to too low boxcut or too low ecut for pseudopotential core charge.<br /><br />I already increased the value of pawecutdg, but without success. The warning message remained.<br /><br />Is it something to be worried about and what should I do to resolve? Or can I simply ignore it?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I can't think of a single calculation that did not display this warning. I never paid it any attention and think you should do the same!<br /><br />Cheers<br />Boris</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Boris,<br /><br />Thank you for your feedback, I appreciate this a lot.<br /><br />It is good to hear that one might ignore this warning.<br /><br />However the log file is completely flooded by this warning. It is hard to detect other warnings.<br /><br />It might be a solution to show only 10 warnings of this type and to summarise the following with a notice on how often this kind of warning occurred.</div>
