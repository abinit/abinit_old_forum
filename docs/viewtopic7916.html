				<h3>Si_band by Abinit+Wannier90</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear all<br /><br />I've studied the steps to calculate a band structure by Abinit+wannier90. I followed the tutorial tw90_4 for Si. The run was OK but the resulting band appears to have a fluctuation along the L-to-G path of the 5th band (the lowest conduction band). Please see the attached band plot. I increased the ecut to 24 to get the reasonably converged ground state density and wave function, and also tried changing around some parameters in the _w90.win file, but still could not get the non-fluctuated line along the mentioned path. The fluctuation even grew bigger when I used sp3 as initial projections. This is rather strange when compared to the Si band obtained from the example provided in the wannier90 package, using the same initial projections. What might be the cause of this result? Am I missing something?. All comments and suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Kind regards, <br />Thanusit Burinprakhon<br /><br />PS. I use Abinit 6.4.1 (MPI version, prepared for a x86_64_linux_gnu4.4 computer). The job was run in serial.<br />The abinit input file is attached. The _w90.win file is exactly the same as that of the tutorial and not attached.</div>

				<div class="content">Have you made a convergence study in terms of k-points? You can improve your results by increasing the number of k-points given to Wannier90. The Hamiltonian in real space H(R) will be defined on more points and the interpolation on the k-grid will be more accurate.<br /><br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">The above result was obtained with ngkpt 444. I tried ngkpt 888 but it didn't help. In fact, the example given in wannier90 package with ngkpt 444 gives a sensible result. So, I think ngkpt is not the key factor responsible for this strange band shape. <br /><br />Thanusit</div>

				<div class="content">Deal all<br /><br />I compared the data in the *.amn and *.mmm files (for Si) obtained from running Abinit tutorial tw90_4 to those provided by example3 in the wannier90 package. The values of data in the same row of the 4th column of the two *.amn file are quite different. Similar behaviour can be observed for those in the 5th column. There are also large differences between the values of data in the *.mmm files from the two sources.  Please see the attached image containing the first few lines of each of the files.<br /><br />Are these suggesting anything?    <br /><br /><br />I checked the list of known problems (in ../doc/abinit/known_problems/known_problems.4.6.x) and found one which seems to involve Wannier function as followed:  <br /><br />P402. (XG021227)<br />NUMERICAL ERROR<br />LIKELY GENERAL<br />Lattice Wannier Function only.<br /><br /><br />I'm not sure if this problem has been fixed in abinit 6.4.1. If not, could it be the source of the above differences of the calculated data and, hence, lead to the strange Si band structure I got.<br /><br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Thanusit</div>

				<div class="content">Your .mmn file would be your problem. Have you tried plotting the band structure with Abinit? If so, do you see the same feature? I believe your problem is from your input file, not from Wannier90. The mmn file is the overlap matrix &lt; u_m (k) | u_n (k+b) &gt;. It will differ from the trial case if you have different wavefunctions (more or less ecut, kpt, etc.).<br /><br />Can you post your input file please?</div>

				<div class="content">You can increase nband in the dataset 1 and use a better k-point grid with non-zero shiftk. This is an FCC system, so <br />nshiftk 4<br />shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5<br />        0.5 0.0 0.0<br />        0.0 0.5 0.0<br />        0.0 0.0 0.5<br />is good (for the dataset 1 only).<br /><br />If this doesn't work, you should consider not doing a disentanglement procedure with Wannier90. I found that this can quite mess up your band structure in some case.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I increased the number of Wannier functions to 12, with the four additional initial projections suggested above. The band seems to get worse. The fluctuation along the L-G path of the 5th band is removed. Please see the attached band plot(Si-band_12WFs.jpg). However, other fluctuations arises along the other paths, for example one along the G-X path (bound by the black closed line).  In addition, there appears the splitting of lines along several sections (highlighted by the green closed lines).      <br /><br />I've tried several combinations of the initial projections. The mixing up between sp3, bonding, and anti-bonding orbitals always gives poor band structure. There is an interesting result in which the suspicious fluctuation is removed  but the small line splitting remains in some sections (bound by green closed lines in the attached band plot Si_band_32WFs.jpg). I used 32 WFs and the sp3 orbitals on each of 8 different sites (bond centres) as the initial projections.  Is this sensible?  If so, is there any other way to further fine tuning this result?  <br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Thanusit</div>

				<div class="content">This is indeed large. To improve upon this, you could change your initial projections. I recommend using the sp3 on Si and the bonding orbitals. However, you shouldn't use r=4 for the sp3 orbitals as you are using a pseudopotential, not a full atomic wavefunction. r=1 (the default value) should be better.<br /><br />You can also increase num_iter to 1000 (or more) to improve the convergence.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br />Please note that the total spread given in my previous post is corresponding to the calculation with 32 Wannier functions and sp3 initial projections. With this condition, I tried using num_iter = 1000 and r=1 but the convergence remains poor (not better than 0.1 Ang^2). I guess my initial projections are not right.<br /><br />I went back to check the total spread obtained from running the input files given earlier, i.e. the original tw90_4 tutorial (with ecut 24) which results in the band fluctuation along the L-G path as shown in my first post. It is very well converged, though, as shown below.  Does it mean that the number of Wannier functions and the initial projections used in the tutorial are already good?

				<div class="content">Hi<br />I think I've got, at least partially, the solution for the above problem. Above all, many thanks to Dr. D.R. Hamann for his kind suggestions that it is crucial to pay a lot of attention on the disentangle energy windows. This is what I missed in the first place. After experimenting with the energy windows (via input parameters: dis_win_min, dis_win_max, dis_froz_min, and dis_froz_max), I've found that to get a decent interpolated Si band structure (with psp: 14si.pspnc, ecut=12, sp3 initial projection):<br />1. the k-grid density should be at least 6 6 6, and<br />2. for a given number of Wannier functions and a numbers of bands entering the interpolation, the disentangle windows must be precisely selected.<br /><br />However, to find the proper energy windows, the way I did was rather trial and errors. I wonder if there is a common criteria for selecting these energy windows. For this, I've tried to study the related  papers suggested in the tutorial but, I have to confess, my theoretical background is simply not enough to get me the answer. Comments and suggestions from experts would greatly help.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Thanusit</div>
