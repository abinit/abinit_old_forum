				<div class="content">Dear Abinit users.<br />I used abinit to meke some ground state calculation and I want to obtain the converged wavefunctions, written as expansion_coefficient*plane_wave.<br />Is there a post processing tool in the abinit package that makes this job?<br />I suppose that this information are written in the _WFK file in fact<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.abinit.org/documentation/helpfiles/for-v6.10/users/abinit_help.html#wavefctfile">http://www.abinit.org/documentation/hel ... avefctfile</a><!-- m --><br />however I wasn't able to read this file. What I need is a file converter that rewrites the information contained in the wfk file in ASCII or another format readable with a text editor.<br />Thank you</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />If you want to have a look at the wavefunction, you can use the cut3d post-processing tool. You can for example visualize the wavefunction for a specific state. You can use cut3d for analyzing densities (_DEN), potentials (_POT), wavefunctions (_WFK), ....<br /><br />I hope it helps you<br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the reply,<br />In fact cut3d is useful to plot the wave-functions, however what I need is the expansion of the wave-functions in plane waves because I need to calculate other quantities that depend on the one electron wave-functions. In fact what I need is a tool to convert the (I think) binary file _WFK to a file readable with a text editor, then I think that I can do the reading by myself.<br />Thank you</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />Well in that case you might have to &quot;hack&quot; a little bit the code. For example you can change the cut3d.F90 routine so that it reads in the wavefunctions (this is already done) and then writes it to a file. I guess it would not be too difficult.<br /><br />But what are the other quantities you are looking for ? Maybe there is already some tool to do this automatically.<br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks again David.<br />In fact modifing the cut3d code is a good idea, nevertheless I solved the problem in a different way.<br /><br />It is possible to make abinit write everything, including the _WFK file, in the netcdf format. It is done by putting &quot;accesswff 3&quot; in the input file. Only little care has to be taken to the &quot;istwfk&quot; that must be 1 for all the k points. Unfortunately I wasn't able to use my converged densities, because I think that the code needs also netcdf files reading the density (for instance in a non-scf run), probably one can bypass this problem with some tricks.<br /><br />Anyway, when one has the output file in netcdf format (they should be &quot;something.nc&quot;) one can use a converter from the nc-format to text-format. One possibility is given by the &quot;ncdump&quot; script (see <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/ncdump-man-1.html">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ne ... man-1.html</a><!-- m --> ), that is released within the abinit package, by writing (for standard installation) <br />ncdump your-file.nc &gt; your-file.txt<br />and it's all over.<br /><br />Hope it helps other users having the same problem as me.<br />Regards<br />Michele</div>
