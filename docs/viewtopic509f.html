				<div class="content">I think the problem is that you should have rfatpol 1 4, not 1 2--you have 4 atoms in the cell, all should be treated, I think that's why anaddb complains about missing perturbations. Note that rfatpol refers to atoms, not to types of atoms--</div>

				<div class="content">As I recall, in the band2eps input file, in the color definition lines you need a red input for each atom, a green for each atom, and so forth. So instead of lines like &quot;0 0&quot; which would be for 2 atoms, you now need &quot;0 0 0 0&quot; for example. I've made that mistake too, and was always slightly puzzled why the program crashes with a dramatic segfault rather than just a more normal complaint. But I've never taken the time to read the code and/or fix up the input parser.</div>
