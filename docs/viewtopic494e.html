				<div class="content">Hello forum,<br /><br />which tools do you use to fit E-V for determining the bulk modulus?<br />Do you have some hints or links for me in &quot;How-To determine the bulk modulus for hcp and wurtzite crystals.&quot;<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Best wishes,<br />Marc</div>

				<div class="content">Well, for the bulk modulus I usually don't use the EOS. Instead, I run a series of calculations as follows:<br /><br />ndtset 5<br /><br />strtarget1 3*3.4D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget2 3*1.7D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget3 3*0.0 3*0.0<br />strtarget4 3*-1.7D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget5 3*-3.4D-5 3*0.0<br /><br />ionmov 2<br />optcell 2<br />ntime 20<br />ecutsm 1.0<br />dilatmx 1.1<br />tolmxf 1.0D-6<br />toldff 1.0D-7 (or tolvrs 1.0D-12 if all ions are on special positions)<br /><br />after these 5 calcs have run, you will have the optimized unit cell volume at 5 pressures: -1.0 GPa, -0.5 GPa, 0.0 GPa, 0.5 GPa, and 1.0 GPa, and you can then fit these data to get B = -V*dP/dV</div>

				<div class="content">Dear  jzwanzig,<br /> <br />I just calculated and i optimized the volume at different pressures and i have to fit the data but plz can you tell me how i can put the initial guess Bo, and when i fit how i can calculate  B = -V*dP/dV .. dP/dV? and V is which volume here.<br /><br /><br /><br />best regards</div>

				<div class="content">What you are trying to compute is B = -V dP/dV at the relaxed (zero pressure) volume. Therefore do a linear fit of P as a function of V, using your calculated results, where V is the unit cell volume (ucvol in the output). The slope of the fit is dP/dV. Then multiply by -V, using the V of the zero pressure run. The resulting B will be in whatever units you used in your fit for P.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Prof.<br /><br /> Thank you very much i calculated Bulk modulus and the result was very good but when am trying to find pressure derivative of bulk modulus B' i got a bad results so can you tell me is there a good method for calculating B' ,  first i calculated the bulk modulus for every volume and then i fitted it with the pressure then i used (   B'=dB/dP )<br /><br /><br />best regards</div>

				<div class="content">To get B' by this method you would have to do A LOT of calculations, it would be easier to just use the Birch Murnaghan EOS. But why do you need to know B'? Typically what's of interest is just B.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Prof.<br />     <br /><br /> Thank you very much and i am agree with you, but another question plz when i calculated Bulk modulus the ucvol in all data set was the same but unitary cell volume are different and i calculates Volume through optcell (i.e i multiplied each optcell three times by it self to get volume) is it true ? and here is my input file:<br /><br />best regards <br /><br /><br />ndtset 5<br /><br />strtarget1 3*3.4D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget2 3*1.7D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget3 3*0.0 3*0.0<br />strtarget4 3*-1.7D-5 3*0.0<br />strtarget5 3*-3.4D-5 3*0.0<br /><br />ionmov 2<br />optcell 2<br />ntime 20<br />ecutsm 1.0<br />dilatmx 1.1<br /><br />#Definition of the unit cell<br />acell 3*10.96 <br />rprim  0.0  0.5  0.5   # FCC primitive vectors (to be scaled by acell)<br />       0.5  0.0  0.5   <br />       0.5  0.5  0.0<br /><br />ntypat 2          <br />znucl 48 16         <br />natom 2               # There is only one atom per cell<br />typat 1 2               # This atom is of type 1<br />xred 0.0  0.0  0.0<br />     0.25 0.25 0.25    # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms<br />ecut  20.99         # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree<br />nstep 10          # Maximal number of SCF cycles<br />toldfe 1.0d-6     # Will stop when, twice in a row, the difference <br />                  # between two consecutive evaluations of total energy <br />                  # differ by less than toldfe (in Hartree)</div>

				<div class="content">Each of your 5 datasets was run with ionmov 2 and optcell 2. Therefore for each one, the cell volume changed as it was optimized. Look through the output file (by hand or with a text search utility like grep) and find the last ucvol for each data set. This will the final, optimized value.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Prof.<br /><br /> Thank you very much for your help, i just want to tell you that i calculated B for a binary compound and the result was very good on LDA, but i tried for GGA i got a big error between my result and  experimental or other theoretical values, also for another compounds i got very bad result with LDA too, so do you prefer i do that by  another method  or???<br /><br /><br />kind regards</div>
