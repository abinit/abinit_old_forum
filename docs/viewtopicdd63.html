				<div class="content">Hello there,<br />How to determine the relationship between pressure and elastic constant, as well as Born effective charge?<br />   According to the tutorial, when we calculate crystal parameters and some physical properties, some common variables were mentioned using the DFPT method. But I am not sure which one is used to determine the relationship between pressure and the results we calculated. <br />In the **.out files, there are some stress tensors, for instance, <br />Cartesian components of stress tensor (hartree/bohr^3)<br />  sigma(1 1)= -7.62016028E-07  sigma(3 2)=  0.00000000E+00<br />  sigma(2 2)= -7.62016028E-07  sigma(3 1)=  0.00000000E+00<br />  sigma(3 3)= -1.18852361E-06  sigma(2 1)=  0.00000000E+00<br />I just think the stress tensors are from the displacement of ion or atom. But if it really has something to so with pressure, how can I obtain that mentioned elationship  ? <br />Hope for your reply, thanks!<br /><br />Best wishes<br />nannan</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />Relationship between the pressure and elastic constants is something what you should calculate by yourself. Just use abinit and dfpt to calculate elastic constants at various pressures. That's it.<br /><br />The pressure is outputted in your output file just after the components of the stress tensor. It's calculated as the minus average of the diagonal components.<br /><br />Also, stress is obtained from the response with respect to the strain of the unit cell, not the atomic displacements. The later in turn give phonons.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Igor L.</div>
