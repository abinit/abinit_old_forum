				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />I wonder if it is currently possible to run structural optimization (ionmov) but keep some of the ions fixed?<br />There are many reasons people do it including coupling to MD (effectively prescribing the boundary conditions in terms of ions positions) <br />as well as some surface energy calculations of the slab with bottom ions fixed during optimization. <br />I know that this option is implemented in VASP, since the book i was looking for give some examples calculated via this code. <br /><br />Do you think it is relatively straight forward to modify Abinit code to implement this?<br />I would assume one could add a couple of lines in those BFGS procedures and actually keep positions of certain ions (given by their index in the rang of [0;natom-1]) fixed, whereas let the others to move towards the minimum. If one is to do so, which files should be actually modified? <br /><br />A related question is, can Abinit be compiled as a library and used from the &quot;driver&quot;? <br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Denis.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Denis,<br /><br /><br />You should look at the natfix/iatfix variables for fixing atoms as well as natfixx, natfixy, natfixz and iatfixx, iatfixy and iatfixz for fixing atoms only in a given direction (or two if you wish).<br /><br /><br />David</div>

				<div class="content">thanks a lot, David! I just started to play with Abinit and missed those variables. That's exactly what i was looking for.</div>
