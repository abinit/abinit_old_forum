				<div class="content">fcc copper has a lattice constant of about 3.61 angstrom, your value corresponds to about twice that. It almost looks like you got the lattice constant from somewhere in Bohr, but thought it was in angstrom and then converted the number to Bohr. Short answer is that your acell is much larger than the physical value for this system.<br /><br />best wishes,<br /><br />Joe</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you Joe,<br /><br />1) trivial error : today I have progressed...<br />Don't remember why  I have put 11.78. There were first trials long ago. The correct anwer is acell 6.84 (6.84 Bohr = 3.6/0.529) and rprim = 0.5 M where M is the matrix of primitive cell I have already written. Also I must not include any correction inside acell, as probably I did.<br />With that prerequisites, I did a little scan between acell 6.44 and acell 7.34, noting Etotal. I notice a parabola with a minimum at -197,4581...Ha, which happens for acell 6.64. (I give here only 4 characteristic digits). Of course, it is possible to refine, these results are not precise, but it seems that near that given distance, we observe an electronic minimum. So I hope I should be on the right way for next steps.<br /><br />2) now that I have corrected the elementary faults, it remains that Etotal concept is not so clear for me. How to add the ''constant'', in order to obtain ''real'' total energy, knowing that for copper for exemple, it is something like -70Ha, ie -1638,...eV ?<br /><br />Will some additional tools or methods give me these figures, or is it a vain tentative, as abinit claims that Total Energy is defined <em class="text-italics">relatively</em> ?  In publications, like<br />''Converged properties of clean metal surfaces by all-electron first-principles calculations'', Juarez L.F. Da Silva a, and al, from Surface Science 600 (2006) 703â€“715<br />They deal with cohesive energy, so Etotal in the global sense, may be interesting. Additionnally I may link Etotal with work function, and not only for copper, so that matter could concern me.<br />So may I let that point 2) open ?...<br /><br />Best wishes<br />JLuc</div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br /><br />In that post for GS of bulk copper, I raised 2 questions :<br /><br />1- pertinence of data in my input file and consequences on calculations,<br />2- meaning of Etotal<br /><br />I consider that Josef W. Zwanziger did really help me on 1; with the correct cell, I re computed energies, WFs, bands, ... Nevertheless It remains that Etotal =-197,... Ha, a considerable figure which is modified by ion-ion interaction -and other terms- to give -70 Ha approximately. Note that all the 11 bands were included in calculation.<br /><br />Regarding 2) it may be an other topic and I propose to ''take my time to learn'' and report that discussion.<br /><br />So I estimate that post as SOLVED.</div>
