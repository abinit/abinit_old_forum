				<h3>Negative Phonon Frequencies</h3>

				<div class="author">by <strong>toughpkh</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Hello,<br />I have tried to generate the phonon band structure by following the RF2 instruction.<br />I obtained a set of q-points(12 points) from GS calculation and set 'nband' to 15. (It gave me errors with less than 15)<br />A material is a rhombohedral structure with 4 basis, and I acquired 'acell' and 'rprim' from the convergence studies.<br />I guess my problems are caused by the definition of k-point grid. First I tried with<br /><br />  ngkpt   4  4  4          <br />  nshifk  1<br />  shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5<br /><br />because it's neither FCC nor BCC. It took more than 30 hrs to generate the dynamical matrices at the q-points and eventually<br />produced negative phonon frequencies at some wave vectors. In addition to the negative frequencies, the shape of the phonon<br />dispersion curves were fluctuating more than expected. I tried to use a different definition on the grid like<br /><br /> nkpt  5<br /> nshifk  1<br /> shiftk 0.5 0.5 0.5<br /> kptrlatt  -2 2 2<br />             2 -2 2<br />             2 2 -2<br /><br />but it kept giving me errors with wrong nkpt values. I've tried more than 10 times with different inputs and pseudopotential data <br />to correct this problem. Any help on this problem will be very appreciated. I looked up the similar posting in the forum, but <br />the answers to the previous posting didn't help. Other parameters in my input files are<br /><br />For the q-points other than gamma point<br />getwfk 1<br />kptopt 3<br />rfphon 1<br />rfatpol   1 5<br />rfdir   1 1 1<br />tolvrs   1.0d-8<br /><br />#Common input variables   <br />ecut 10<br />nband 15<br />ixc 1<br />iscf 5<br />nstep 100<br /><br />The rest of the parameters are the same as the inputs in RF2 tutorial.<br />Thank you.</div>

				<div class="content">I think you should tighten the convergence parameter together with a larger nstep. I use &quot;tolwfr  1.0d-22&quot; and &quot;nstep 1000&quot;.<br /><br />Additionally, is you geometrical structure fully relaxed?  I use &quot;tolmxf   1.85d-6&quot; in such calculation. <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

				<div class="content">Your ecut is quite low, especially if you're using norm-conversing pseudo. Are you sure you are converged?<br /><br />Also, your k-grid seems small (it's hard to tell without rprim and acell). Increasing it might get rid of these imaginary frequencies.<br /><br />Simon</div>

				<div class="content">Thank you, Guangfu and Simon.<br /><br />My geometrical structure is fully relaxed, and 'ecut' in my simulations was actually 20.<br />My 'ngkpt 4 4 4' was from the convergence study as following the tutorial#4, <br />and my simulation took more than 100 hrs to get the final results. Do I still need to try with larger k-grid?<br /> <br />I just got another error message from the latest simulation. <br /><br />scfcge : ERROR -<br />  Potential-based CG line minimization not converged after 13 restarts.<br />  Action : read the eventual warnings about lack of convergence.<br />  Some might be relevant. Otherwise, raise nband.<br /><br />Would it be due to the insufficient 'ntstep'? I am still not sure if it needs to be greater than 200.<br />Someone in the forum suggested to use iscf 7 instead of iscf 5 to recover the error above.<br />Is it also okay for the response calculation?<br /><br />I'll try to run a new simulation with your suggestions, reduced the tolerances and larger nstep.<br />I really appreciate your helps.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Jung</div>
