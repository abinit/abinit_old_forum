				<h3>MgO &amp; CaO pseudotentials</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Thu Mar 18, 2010 1:48 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br />I'm a beginner in the use of Abinit for quantum chemistry calculations. I wanted to start with the &quot;simple&quot; case of the MgO structure (Fm3m). I'm performing the calculations in the PAW mode, with the GGA-made pseudopotentials given on the website. Strange thing is that, these pseudopotentials are made to be used (or have been tested) in the case of a MgO (great for me so!), but with performing the optimization of the cell, it's giving me an error message about the overlap of densities of the order of 27% (overlap usually accepted is less than 5%). Is that normal?<br />In a second time if I'm launching the calculations, putting an overlap acceptance of more than 27% (which seems to be dangerous, because of possible inaccuracy of the results), I'm finding a cell size (acell) of 2.977 Bohr (instead of around 4.2, like used at the beginning).<br /><br />Are there any corrections to give to the pseudopotential file ?<br /><br />I'm also trying to do the same type of calculations for the CaO crystal (same structure, Fm3m), and I have to build, this time, the pseudopotential. Any advices?</div>

				<div class="content">Hum... I see. I've just made one of the most stupid mistake of my life... This way, the overlap totally disappear, that's the best part.<br />Remains that the lattice parameter obtained is still too small (around 2.99 Angstr) in regards of the value with which we started (4.211 Angstr).<br />Thank you very much for this first big step anyway!</div>

				<div class="content">Which PAW sets are you using exactly? My own Mg and O PAW sets with PBE give a lattice constant 2% longer than experiment and a bulk modulus of 150 GPa (rather than 165 GPa). This is fairly typical behavior for PBE.</div>

For example for the Mg, I've created a pseudo like that :<br />-Valence electrons : 3s orbitals<br />- lmax = 0<br />- Critical radius rc = 2.67 Bohr (the covalent radius of the atom)<br />- with a pseudization based on the following processes : &quot;custom RRKJ&quot; and &quot;bessel&quot;. <br />- and two basis set wavefunctions (limited with the same critical radius)<br /><br />With my input file, I'm having the same problem, meaning that the cell is contracting too much, whatever are the pseudopotentials used.<br /><br />Edit : Isn't that strange to find a lattice parameter of 2% longer in regards of experimental results, as this calculations are made theoritically at 0K ? (so the cell should contract, not extend)</div>
