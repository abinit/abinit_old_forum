				<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />I am quite new in the community. <br /><br />I have successfully compiled abinit8.0.8 on our debian8 plateform.<br /><br />After executing the tests, I observed some deviations to the expected values (quite large from my point of view).<br /><br />Below a summary of the execution of tests and attached is my config.log file:<br /><br /><strong class="text-strong">make test_fast</strong><br />cp ./src/98_main/abinit ../tests/built-in/Input/abinit &amp;&amp;

The run finished cleanly.<br />     Moreover, comparison of the total energy, and other (few) relevant quantities with reference values has been successful.<br />     This does not mean that no problem is present, however. <br />     Please run the complete set of ABINIT tests to gain a better confidence in your installation.<br /> <br /><strong class="text-strong">make test_v1</strong><br />cp ./src/98_main/abinit ../tests/built-in/Input/abinit &amp;&amp;

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />Depending on you cpu, your librairies, and so one, deviations are expected. It is hard to say if they're significant or not in you case since they are quite larger than the deviation extracted from our test farm.<br />This being said, our test farm is not exhaustive so the expected deviation may be wrong.<br />To be sure, the developers of the features you tested and did not passed should have a look but we may not be able to reproduce your results. So it is very hard to debug.<br />You can run the full testfarm to have a larger overview of what seems to work and does not.<br /><br />Cheers</div>
