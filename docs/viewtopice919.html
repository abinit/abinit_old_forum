				<div class="content">Hi all, <br />I tried to run the configure file on Blue Gene but everytime it gives me an error. My hostname.ac file is as follows:<br /><br />CC=&quot;mpixlc&quot;<br />CXX=&quot;mpixlcxx&quot;<br />FC=&quot;mpixlf90&quot;<br />F77=&quot;mpixlf77&quot;<br />enable_fc_wrapper=&quot;yes&quot;<br />#enable_stdin=&quot;no&quot;<br />enable_mpi=&quot;yes&quot;<br />enable_mpi_io=&quot;yes&quot;<br />MPI_RUNNER=&quot;/bgl/BlueLight/ppcfloor/bglsys/bin/mpirun&quot;<br />#enable_dft=&quot;no&quot;<br />#with_dft_flavor=&quot;libxc&quot;<br />#enable_netcdf=&quot;no&quot;<br />#enable_wannier90=&quot;no&quot;<br /><br />When I compile, I use cross-compiling by specifying --host=powerpc-unknown-linux. However this prompts an error saying<br /><br />checking whether to build netcdf... yes<br />checking whether to build wannier90... yes<br />configure: using tarball repository /XXXX(my directory)/.abinit/tarballs<br />checking for a source tarball of LINALG... no<br />configure: downloading LINALG - this may take a while<br />checking availability of LINALG from URL 1... no<br />configure: WARNING: could not download LINALG fallback tarball<br />configure: error: cannot build Abinit - aborting<br /><br />But if I tried to uncomment the last line of my hostname.ac file, it will not run at all. <br />Can anybody give me a hint about this error? Thank you so much!</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />Abinit stops because it cannot find the linear algebra libraries. Therefore, you need to specify yourself the linear algebra libraries that you want to use. I think mkl is available on Blue Gene. So try to to add (for instance with mkl):<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>&nbsp;--with-linalg-flavor=mkl&nbsp; --with-linalg-libs=&quot;-L/path/to/mkl/libraries/lib/em64 -lblas -llapack&quot;</code></pre></div><br /><br />Boris<br /><br />Edit : Or maybe you can download the <a href="http://archives.abinit.org/plugins/lapack-abinit_6.0.tar.gz" class="postlink">lapack libraries</a> on the abinit website, put them in the /tarballs directory and Abinit will install them automatically. I did not try this option but it should work.</div>

Then I guess the simplest way of doing this is to DL the lapack libraries on the abinit website.</div>

Thank you very much! But when I type &quot;make&quot; command, it gave me an error after 5 minutes or so, saying &quot;cannot run C compiled files, if you mean to cross-compile, use --host&quot;. I have met this error many times before because I am using cross-compiling. In my configure command, I specified --host=powerpc-unknown-linux, which is correct. But I don't think make --host=powerpc-unknown-linux will work since this is not an option of make.<br />Could you please tell me where the problem is? Thank you very much!<br />Best regards<br /><br />BTW: I have attached my config.log file, after the make command. You may check it if needed. This is actually a .zip file. Since the original file is over 256kb size and the forum won't accept the compressed format(zip), I have to compress it and modify the extension. So please change the extension to zip and extract it. Thank you very much!<br /><br />More to mention:<br />There seems no change after the make command, so I am putting the result of the make command:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>checking whether a win32 DLL is desired... no<br />checking whether separate fortran libs are desired... no<br />configure: finding C compiler<br />checking whether the C compiler works... yes<br />checking for C compiler default output file name... a.out<br />checking for suffix of executables...<br />checking whether we are cross compiling... configure: error: in `/XXXX/abinit-6.6.1/plugins/netcdf/netcdf-4.1.1':<br />configure: error: cannot run C compiled programs.<br />If you meant to cross compile, use `--host'.<br />See `config.log' for more details.<br />make&#91;4&#93;: *** &#91;configure-stamp&#93; Error 1<br />make&#91;4&#93;: Leaving directory `/XXXX/abinit-6.6.1/plugins/netcdf'<br />make&#91;3&#93;: *** &#91;package-ready&#93; Error 2<br />make&#91;3&#93;: Leaving directory `/XXXX/abinit-6.6.1/plugins/netcdf'<br />make&#91;2&#93;: *** &#91;all-recursive&#93; Error 1<br />make&#91;2&#93;: Leaving directory `/XXXX/abinit-6.6.1/plugins'<br />make&#91;1&#93;: *** &#91;all-recursive&#93; Error 1<br />make&#91;1&#93;: Leaving directory `/XXXX/abinit-6.6.1'<br />make: *** &#91;all&#93; Error 2<br /></code></pre></div></div>

				<div class="content">Without more precise information, I cannot pinpoint the exact problem you're encountering.<br /><br />However, this is likely an error during the compilation of an external package. If you don't need any advanced feature, you can try to configure with the following options:<br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>../configure --with-trio-flavor=&quot;none&quot; --with-dft-flavor=&quot;none&quot;</code></pre></div><br />This will remove support for NetCDF, ETSF_IO, FoX, AtomPAW, BigDFT, LibXC, and Wannier90.<br /><br />You may also try with only one of these two options.</div>

Thank you very much! But there is a new problem. I run the tgw1_1.in file with bluegene. I specified 512 nodes to it and it takes 180 seconds to complete the calculation. But if I use 32 AMD processors it takes only 43 seconds. In our common sense, Blue Gene is faster than normal AMD processors. But why there is such a big difference? I don't know what information you guys need, so would you please reply to tell me that? Thank you so much!<br />Best regards!<br />xiangpisai</div>

				<div class="content">Dear xiangpisai,<br /><br />Despite the common sense proverb saying quod abundat non vitiat, it is quite easy to do less with more.<br /><br />First of all, the input files of the test suite are designed to check accuracy, not as  benchmarks for speed - at least not without modifications. So don't take any of them, launch it on 512 cpus and expect a 512 fold increase of performance. Abinit has several options to parallelize computations, some of them scale linealy, others not - the art of clusters is to weight resources vs. efficiency, not to use brute force.<br /><br />For the particular case of tgw1_1, considering the plain k-points grid as defined, I would say that about a quarter of your 512 cpus were busy calculating and the rest slowing down the process (and it's probably even worse than that).<br />So please have a look on the tutorials and variables relevant to Abinit parallelization and, in particular, the paral_kgb variable with negative values that can provide a guidance about the efficiency of parallel options in your specific input. And maybe look at tests/paral/Input/si_kpt_band_fft.in as a starting point to design a large scale benchmark and study the effects of the different combinations.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>
