				<h3>smearing for projected dos on angular momentum channels</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear abinit users,<br />When using prtdos=3, with the proper variable declorations for natsph, iatsph, and ratsph a DOS output is created in my outputs directory (performing normally). <br /><br />An issue occurs that I have found no variable to control. The output DOS contains the S P D F and G dos and integrated values. The problem exists with the data where sharp peaks appear when plotting, creating delta function-like peaks  throughout the plot, lets say when plotting the D l=2 column with the energy. Is there any way to smear the pdos so that a smooth plot can be formed? (where the delta functions become broad) <br />With prtdos=1, you can use tsmear but prtdos=3 has no difference with different values of tsmear. <br /><br />Is there a variable of interest, or is there a post processing tool that can help with this issue? <br />I have converged my kpt grid and that is not the issue. <br /><br />I read somewhere that you can take a running average to help smear or broaden the data, but I have no idea how to do this. I would think that I am missing a variable because a pdso without an ability to smear or broaden seems a little rigid<br />Thanks for any suggestions or solutions</div>

				<div class="content">Hi!<br /><br />I think it occurs because prtdos=3 uses tetrahedron method as prtdos=2. Try using prtdos=1, which uses smearing method to calculate dos.<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />Igor</div>

				<div class="content">When prtdos = 1, you can use tsmear to control the smearing of the &quot;total dos&quot;. I tried to declare the pdos variables when using prtdos = 1 but it just formed the total dos as an output.<br />Is there a way to obtain the dos for the S, P, D, F, and G orbitals where you can smear the results to obtain smooth plots? or do you have to use some post processing functions to achieve this?</div>

I don't know of any post-processing tool for that.<br /><br />Igor</div>

				<div class="content">I also having same problems, along with that the numbers I am getting in y-axis for both in total dos and atomic contributions are substantially different. Why is that ?</div>
