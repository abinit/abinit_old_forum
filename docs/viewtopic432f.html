<br>
I hope this will be a simple question but I cannot find anything on the forum about it.<br>
<br>
How does one calculate all of the mode frequencies/the dynamical matrix (with either anaddb or abinit) from a single q-vector when you did the calculation in parts? I.e, the cell was so large that a single q-point DFPT calculation required you to merge several DDBs with mrgddb.<br>
<br>
You get a truncated version of the frequencies and the dynamical matrix at the end of each (truncated) run, but this warns you that it is not the full dynamical matrix:<br>
<br>
 chkph3 : WARNING -<br>
  The dynamical matrix was incomplete : phonon frequencies may be wrong ...<br>
<br>
In Anaddb, I cannot find how to specify only a single q-point rather than a grid (unless of course it's at Gamma and ngkpt can be set to 1 1 1) <br>
<br>
So, how do I get the frequencies in this case?<br>
<br>
Best,<br>
<br>
