				<div class="content">I have been trying to do constant D computations wth abinit and having occasional success but some structures always crash. I compiled initberry and berryphase_new with bounds checking and extra printouts, and it seems clear there is a problem. Usually it just crashes with no useful traceback or error but now I get: back trace terminated abnormally. forrtl: severe (408): fort: (2): Subscript #1 of the array INDKK_F2IBZ has value 26371 which is greater than the upper bound of 512 , which is some key. This is for a 8x8x8 k-point mesh on 128 processors. I find that even on 1 cpu (which is very slow) it also crashes , so it seems not to just be a parallelization problem. However, even when I run on one processors nprocs correctly is shown as 1, but Num_procs is given incorrectly in the output. This number shows as  4 when I run on 128 processors and as 64 when I run on 1! So with mpirun -bootstrap slurm  -n 128  abinit_check &lt;files &gt;&amp;OUTFILE<br /> I see nproc =    128:<br />==== OpenMP parallelism is ON ====<br />- Max_threads:       2<br />- Num_threads:       2<br />- Num_procs:         4<br />- Dynamic:           F<br />- Nested:            F<br />and with nproc =    1<br />I see<br />==== OpenMP parallelism is ON ====<br />- Max_threads:       2<br />- Num_threads:       2<br />- Num_procs:         256<br />- Dynamic:           F<br />- Nested:            F<br /><br />I get similar failures with export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 , so that is not the problem.<br />I am running on an Intel KNL clyster with 64 cores per node.<br />Maybe something like this is causing dimensioning to go awry. I do see that the call that is used in the num-procs above is not good, because it just reports the numbers <br />of cores free &quot;at that time on the device,&quot; whereas the nproc number is the correct one. Maybe this is a red herring. Anyway, and help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Sometimes instead of an mpi crash or bonds crash, I see the error &quot;the determinant of the overlap matrix is found to be 0.&quot; Anyway, I suspect one or more dimensioning problems in the Berry's phase routines.<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Ron Cohen<br /><!-- e --><a href="mailto:rcohen@carnegiescience.edu">rcohen@carnegiescience.edu</a><!-- e --></div>

				<div class="content">I built ABINIT 7.10.5 and ran with the same input and environment, and it seems to run OK. So it does seem to be a problem with ABINIT 8. I attached the beginning of the output for 7.10.5 . I also include abinit -b output from both builds. Thanks,<br /><br />Ron</div>
