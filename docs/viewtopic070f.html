				<h3>LOTF integration in 7.1.2 (MOVER.F90)</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello,<br />I am integrating the LOTF method in a recent version of ABINIT and I have some doubts <br />on the &quot;correct way&quot; to do things.<br />In the previous weeks I integrated LOTF in a old version of abinit (5.5) (this step was needed because<br />the old LOTF code was a long F77 file which I translated in a more modern F90).<br />Now passing to the new version of ABINIT and the new structure of MOVER procedure (scfcv+specialized predictor) <br />is giving me some trouble.<br /><br />LOTF passes SCFCV 2 times at the first step (itime=1): the first is a normal cycle while in the second one it uses some extrapolated <br />atom positions to compute a set of parameters which will be used in the next steps.<br />The results of this second call to SCFCV should be not stored at all.<br />In the following steps (saying 10) the SCFCV should be shortcut.<br /><br />From my point of view, the ideal and simpler, should be to integrate the call to SCFCV in the LOTF predictor as was done in 5.5 version.<br />Is it possible (ethically) to do it? <br /><br />Best regards,<br />Marco</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Marco,<br /><br />First of all, you should probably contact Guillermo Avendano (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:guillermo.avendano@uclouvain.be">guillermo.avendano@uclouvain.be</a><!-- e -->) who is the author of the mover and predictors routines.<br /><br />Second point:<br />Reading your message, I'm wondering if the 2nd (not stored) call to scfcv could perturb the calculations.<br />From one call to scfcv to another, several quantitites are transmitted, mainly the density and the wave functions, and used in predictor algorithm using a scf_history datastructure.<br />They are used to start each SCF cycle. Your second call to scfcv could perturb this and make the first few calls to scfcv unefficient.<br />Is it possible to make this 2nd call to scfcv at first ?... and then to re-initialize everything (cd, rhor, ...) ?<br /><br />Apparently, this second call to scfcv is the only difference between LOTF enad other predictors, right ?<br />If yes, you could just add this second call to your predict_lotf routine and let the other calls to scfcv in mover.<br />Is it your idea ?<br />Doing this, if really nothing is stored from the 2nd call to scfcv, you can imagine to create a fake scfcv_args datastructure inside predict_lotf, then call scfcv, keep the data you are interested in and destroy this fake scfcv_args...<br />Doing this, I think you keep the structure scfcv/predictor/hist intact...<br />But perhaps, I am missing one point and this idea is bad...<br /><br />That's just a first idea...<br /><br />The best,<br /><br />Marc</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Marc,<br />thanks for your reply.<br />I contacted yet Guillermo and he is helping me.<br /><br />I am sorry if my post is not very clear. Here a little schema which I hope will be more clear:<br /><br />In the first step two GS are to be computed while for the following only one:<br />t=1) compute GS in t=1, <br />       LOTF potential for t=1:  alpha_in<br />       from extrapolation, position at t=10 are computed <br />       GS(t=10)<br />       LOTF potential for t=10:  alpha_out<br />t=2) no GS, but used the interpolated LOTF potential in the interval (a_in,a_out)<br />...<br />...<br />t=11) alpha_in=alpha_out; <br />       from extrapolation, positions at t=20 are computed <br />       GS(t=20)<br />       LOTF potential for t=20:  alpha_out<br />t=12)  as  t=2)<br />....<br /><br />So the difference is not only in the first cycle but also in the other where GS is not computed<br />at the time t but on t+10. Then the position at t=n+10 where 1&lt;=n&lt;10 are computed by LOTF using intepolation.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Marco,<br /><br />OK I understand.<br />But this not so different...<br />You just have to call scfcv twice each 10 steps...<br /><br />My ideas are still applicable for each of these steps (1, 11, 21, ...).<br />1) Have a correct management of cg, rhor, scf_history in order to help the SCF cycle to converge<br />(you should eliminate from the history the second call to scfcv done at steps 1, 11, 21...)<br />2) Hide the second call to scfcv in your predict_loft predictor and use temporary (fake) values for scfcv_args<br /><br />If you do that, you can keep the current flowchart of mover.<br />Especially for 2), if you do that, you just consider that the second call to scfcv is a part of the predictor ; in fact, this the case, right ?</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Marc,<br />In the version of LOTF integrated in ABINIT 5.5 the &quot;predictor&quot; (in this cas was directly in MOLDYN.F90)<br />had a call to scfcv but now is seems that I can't do that: predictor can not contain scfcv.<br />DO you thing that I can do that?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Marco</div>

				<div class="content">Hello Marc,<br />Ok I think that now it works!<br /><br />I have not integrated the SCFCV in PRED_LOTF.<br />I have followed the suggestions that Guillermo and you given me.<br /><br />when I have to do extrapolation at time t (any 10 steps for example), I set the number of ncycle=2<br />In the first cycle SCFCV computes the forces at time t (in the old method I didn't recompute this) and<br />the extrapolated position at t+10 (Storing the old position and velocities in local saved arrays)<br />Then the second cycle call SCFCV in the positions at t+10 (and the predictor restore the values for t):<br /><br /><br />t=1) icycle=1) compute GS in t=1, <br />     predictor:<br />                  -LOTF potential for t=1: alpha_in<br />                  -Stored pos,vel (pos_old=pos,...)<br />                  -by extrapolation, position at t=10 are computed <br />                   <br />t=1) icycle=2) compute GS in t=10, <br />     predictor:<br />                  -LOTF potential for t=10: alpha_out<br />                  -restore pos,vel (pos=pos_old,... )<br />                  -new positions, new alpha for the next step (interpolation)<br />t=2) no GS, but used the interpolated LOTF potential in the interval (a_in,a_out)<br />...<br />...<br />t=11) icycle=1) as in 1)2)<br />t=11) icycle=2) as in 1)1)<br />t=12) as t=2)<br />....<br /><br /><br />In this way the algorithm is more symmetric and then simpler to integrate.<br /><br />But I have still some doubts concerning the HIST file and MOLDYN.<br />Which is the more appropriate way to store my results in them?<br />If I leave as ABINIT do I have twice t=1,11... in HIST file but not in MOLDYN. <br />Which icycle is used by MOLDYN to store data (for me should be 1)? <br />I was looking in MOVER.F90 but, for me, it is not very simple to understand.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Marco</div>
