				<div class="content">Hai <br /><br />I am trying to obtain the accurate density of states  (dos) of intrinsic graphene in which the density of states is zero at Fermi level set at 0 eV. <br />I got the dos plot of graphene, but it contains artificial wiggles i.e oscillations.<br />I found from the abinit tutorial that increasing the number of k points the oscillations can be reduced.<br />How can I increase the k points? For that as the first step, I need to calculate nkpt.<br />As the number of k points in the Brillouin zone is automatically generated by ngkpt, kptopt and shiftk, how to calculate the nkpt from the following input variables used:<br />kptopt 1 <br />ngkpt 45 45 1<br />nshiftk 1<br />shiftk 0.0 0.0 0.0<br /><br />Can anyone guide me in this regard.<br />Does anyone have the input file for dos computation of intrinsic graphene</div>

				<div class="content">I will try to help on the nkpt issue....<br />kptopt = 1 auto generates k point grids based on the variables ngkpt, shiftk, and nshiftk in the irreduceable BZ.<br /><br />To test what the value of nkpt is, just look at your log file or output file and look in the echo of input variables section<br />probably nkpt = 28 but I am not exactly sure.<br />To see what the value of the k points are, also look at kpt = (which would be a list)<br />With your values, kpt probably looks something like<br />kpt = 0.015 0.0 0.0<br />0.03 0.0 0.0<br />... ... ...<br /><br />While using kptopt = 1, to adjust the number of k points, adjust the value of ngkpt<br />It looks like you have a one-dimensional wire in the x direction and adjusting the value of the 1st number will add or subtract more k points in the B1 reciprocal vector<br /> <br />To better understand kptopt, ngkpt, shiftk, and nshiftk, I would look at the meanings in the abinit variable documentation and adjust values to see their effects</div>

				<div class="content">Seems like something has changed in this question and just to clear up my response from before. <br />ngkpt = 45 45 1 # a 2 dimensional structure <br />nkpt = 484 # 22X22X1<br />shiftk = 0 0 0 # makes sure that the kpt grid starts on the gamma point<br /><br />I thought that you are supposed to obtain the correct k point grid through a kpt convergence in the self consistent case and then use that value the rest of the way?</div>
