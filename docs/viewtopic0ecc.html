				<div class="content">kptopt -3, kptbounds and ndivk are used to define the k-path for the band structure calculation<br />within the Kohn-Sham formalism in which the NSCF Hamiltonian can be <br />easily constructed  at an arbitrary k-point starting from the density.<br />These variables are meaningless for GW in which the set of k-points for the QP corrections <br />is restricted to the k-mesh used to generate the KSS file.<br /><br />You have to use the default kptopt=1, and the set of variables ngkpt, nshiftk and shiftk to define the BZ sampling <br />to be used for calculating the screened interaction and the self-energy. Remember that these values *must* be equal <br />to the ones used to generate the KSS file. <br /><br />Matteo</div>

And from the help file and some related documents, some similar opinions are demonstrated. Indeed, in the scrrening calculation, probablely the regular k grid including some interesting k points needs to be given. the assignment of k points as provided above can't be performed in GW calculation in ab init.<br />so, express my thanks to you again for your provision.</div>

				<div class="content">is there any way to determine k-points in screening calculation <br /><br />for example<br /><br />we want to GW correct on 40 k-points and this points were divided four section <br /><br />1 A point <br />2 Gama point <br />3 M point <br />4 L point <br /><br />this point is in brillioun zone of ZnO wurtzide <br /><br />and i want to obtain true band structure on this point <br /><br />thank you</div>
