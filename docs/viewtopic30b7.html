				<div class="content">Hi all,<br /><br />Does Abinit have the capability of running ab initio calculation of optical spectra of liquids using many body effects in the electronic excitations of liquids (BSE) ?<br />If not, does any one know of any other program which potentially is able to tackle this issue ???<br /><br />Bests<br />Vito</div>

				<div class="content">There's no limitation in the code that prevents you from computing BSE spectra for liquids with Abinit.<br />Note, however, that Abinit is a planewave-based code and therefore it does not represent the most efficient<br />approach for the analysis of non-periodic systems. You have to simulate the liquid with a supercell <br />of appropriate size --&gt; many G vectors in the basis set --&gt; a *lot* of memory and a significant increase in the CPU time.<br /><br />So the main questions are<br /><br />* Do you have enough computing capabilities available? For example, can you run a &quot;simple&quot; GS calculation for your system?<br /><br />* If the system is too expensive even at the GS level, I suggest looking for other approaches based on a different basis set. <br />   bigdft is a interesting alternative for these kind of systems but, as far as I know, BSE is not coded. <br />    Octopus (real space grid) can compute spectra within TDDFT that is much less  CPU and memory demanding than BSE. <br />    All the BSE codes I'm aware of are either all-electron or are based on pseudopotentials and planewaves. <br />    Perhaps there are other alternatives but I didn't make any extensive search on the internet.</div>

				<div class="content">TDDFT gives unfortunately very poor result for absorption spectrum of a very simple system like water.<br />I have  enough computing capabilities but not enough for BSE liquid calculations.<br />Any way i have to forget it.<br /><br />Thanks</div>
