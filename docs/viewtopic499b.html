				<h3>Spinor wavefunction from cut3d</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello!<br /><br />I'm trying to do some grouptheoretical calculations with the wavefunctions which I can get from cut3d.<br /><br />My calculations with materials, which can be calculated without spin-orbit-coupling (like Cu or GaP) show perfect results compared with theory. But when I want to do grouptheoretical projections of spinor wavefunctions (for e.g. SnTe), I notice, that I have to &quot;rotate&quot; the spinor components by a certain angle to get the results, which I expect.<br /><br />To rotate the spinor, I extract both components with cut3d and place the field in a vector. The I apply a standard rotationmatrix to get my modified spinor. I noticed, that an angle of pi/4 suits my needs for every k-point in a bandstructure along W-L-G-X-K-G.<br /><br />Are the spinor-components not aligned to the z-axis, or is there something else, I didn't notice?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Sunny<br /><br />BTW: The names of the output files for the two spinor components are the same and thus are overwritten by eachother...</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, sounds interesting. Would you consider showing us what you use to project the wf?<br /><br />At any rate, the default L in L.s is oriented according to the normal axes, with z along z... The rotation you describe does sound suspicious in that it is the same for all k along a path with very different directions. Which unit cell are you using? How do you know you get what you expect? I would have imagined the expressions for the irreps would be summed over spinor index and independent of the rotation, but perhaps not.<br /><br />PS: I have added a suffix for the spinor component in an upcoming version of abinit.<br /><br />best<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
