				<div class="content">Does anyone have any input on the above error? I do appreciate any help.<br /><br />By the way, I also installed Abinit 10.7.5 with gcc 4.9 compiler and the same error happened afetr the first dataset finished.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Masoomeh,<br /><br />your run is not able to print the output WFK file at the end of dataset 1. This seems to be a network disk related issue (not abinit related) - perhaps you can post your job submission file and &quot;files&quot; file, but normally only your local sysadmin can fix this kind of thing for you (probably just tell you what you are doing wrong in the setting up of paths and directories for execution and in your files file). <br /><br />It could also be an issue with parallel io over your network. Could you try a test run in sequential (1 proc), perhaps with very low nstep and ecut, to see if it can save the file? Are all of the files on a local scratch on the node, and are you running on a single node? NB: if you run on several nodes and the WFK are stored on local disks, only the mother node has access to the WFK to start DS2 - this is a classic error - and will fail. If you copy stuff back to your original submission directory, and relaunch DS2 it will work because the WFK is now copied to all participating nodes.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Matthieu</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Matthieu,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply. You are right. I did a test and the job works fine on one node. At least, now I know that it is not abinit-related. I have contacted our grid support to see how I can run on more nodes.</div>
