				<h3>[SOLVED]Probable bug in the ddk calculation or optic analysi</h3>
				<div class="date">Posted: <strong>Sun Aug 14, 2011 11:53 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Dear developers,<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier (<!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopice264-2.html?f=10&amp;t=1153">viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=1153</a><!-- l -->), I found that ABINIT (both 6.2.2 and 6.8.1) gives wrong linear optical spectrum in several 1D systems by using the usual procedures. Here I elaborate this issue with a simple example of carbon chain.<br /><br />The known procedures to get linear optical spectrum are as follows: (1) SCF calculation to get the electron density of ground state; (2) NSCF calculation to get wavefunction with denser k-point grid and more empty bands; (3) ddk calculation to get the derivatives of wavefunction with respect to k, and then using optic program to get the dielectric function.<br /><br />In the case of carbon chain system, I find that the (2)-step must be SCF to get correct optical results, which are confirmed by calculations of YAMBO and CASTEP. To simplify the explanation, I did the following tests: (a) generate the KSS by using ABINIT, which also outputs WFK; (b) calculate the ddk and spectrum by using both ABINIT and YAMBO. I find that YAMBO gives correct spectrum whether the (a)-step is NSCF or SCF, while ABINIT give wrong result when the (a)-step is NSCF. This clearly shows that there must be some problem. Test files and comparison graph are attached for your confirmation.<br /><br />An interesting phenomenon possibly indicates the cause: only 1 SCF step in (a) is enough for ABINIT to get correct result, though I also tried 1000 steps! Maybe the ddk calculation or optic analysis does get correct information from a NSCF wavefunction. <br /><br />Because this ddk calculation and optic analysis are relevant to several other RF calculations, like IR and Raman, this issue really matters. I am looking forward to detail analyses from you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo<br /><br /><br />P.S. I checked the file-header of the NSCF and SCF WFK and did find differences: in the NSCF WFK, there are 2 fully occupied bands (4 electrons) according to “occ”, while in the SCF WFK, there are 3 fully occupied bands (6 electrons). The unit cell contains only 1 carbon atom.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure I understand your post fully. You suggest that you think that there is a problem in the ddk calculation, but as I read your post your tests involve how you determine the GS wavefunctions (SCF followed by NSCF, or SCF followed by a second SCF run). Concerning the DDK calculation itself, the equation being solved is a Sternheimer equation in which self-consistency is not an issue (right hand side is a constant, thus the calculation is inherently &quot;non-self-consistent&quot;). The DDK output has been checked quite thoroughly in both the norm-conserving and PAW cases against finite difference calculations. You can repeat these checks for your system, see test V3/test_09 for an example of how to do it.</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Prof. Zwanziger,<br /><br />Thanks for your reply. Actually, I followed the same procedures to do ddk calculation as the tutorials, and did get correct results for many systems. But in the 1D chain systems, I happened to notice that the usual procedure gave wrong results, which are confirmed by other programs. So I did lots of tests to locate the cause. Finally, after comparing the calculations by using YAMBO and ABINIT (since Yambo can use the wavefunction from ABINIT), I find that the ddk calculation probably does not get correct information from a NSCF (but SCF) wavefunction, at least in my case.<br /><br />If you like, you can calculate the imaginary part of the dielectric function of the 1D carbon chain system in your own way. The structure is extremely simple: a carbon atom in the center of 10 x 10 x 1.2801 (angstrom) box. <br /> <br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Prof. Zwanziger,<br /><br />Thanks for your suggestion. But it is embarrassing that I do not know how to easily do a finite difference check on the ddk of wavefunction. <br /><br />However, I did another test and find that the problem could be in the final optic analysis code rather than the ddk calculation. Since in optic analysis step, using ddk-from-NSCF-WFK and the SCF-WFK can also get the correct result.  <br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

				<div class="content">Dear All,<br /><br />I disscussed the problem with Matthieu in another post, and as him pointed out, the occupations in SCF and NSCF WFK are different. After switching iscf=-2 to iscf=-3 (the later initializes occ and wtk), I got correct optical spectra.<br /><br />The cause could be the incorrect band filling in the WFK from iscf=-2, which subsequently causes incorrect electron transition in the optic analysis.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>
