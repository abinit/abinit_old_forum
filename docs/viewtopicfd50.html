				<h3>The GW tutorial : addressing cross-convergence</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear all,<br /><br />There is some issue with the GW tutorial I would like to discuss. Although it does a good job at showing all the parameters of a GW calculation, it says nothing about the interdependence of these parameters during a convergence study. It might be worth mentioning that ecuteps, nband in sigma and nband in screening must be crossed-converged. I've come with the following procedure to ensure reliability of the converged parameters. <br /><br /><br />1) Produce a KSS file with high ecut (30 Ha) and number of bands (800).<br />	Note that for such a high number of bands, one should carefully look at the warnings <br />	to make sure the wave functions were converged.<br /><br />2) Produce a SCR file with moderately high ecuteps (10 Ha) and number of bands (500),<br />	keeping ecutwfn = ecut<br /><br />3) 	3.1) (optional) Make a convergence study on ecutsigx.<br />		Note that this parameter does not depend on ecuteps or any parameter <br />		used in the screening.<br /><br />	3.2) Make a convergence study on ecutwfn with a high number of band (600),<br />		If the maximum value of ecutwfn  you can pick (the ecut used in the kss) <br />		turns out to be under-converged, go back to step 1), raising ecut..<br /><br />4) Make a convergence study on nband used in sigma. <br />	If nband in the kss turns out to be under converged, go back to step 1, raising nband.<br />	If nband used at step 3.2 was under converged, go back to step 3.2, raising nband.<br /><br />5) Make a convergence study on ecuteps.<br />	If ecuteps used at step 4 was under converged, go back to step 4, using a screening <br />	file with sufficient ecuteps.<br /><br />6) Make a convergence study on nband used in the screening.<br />	If nband in the screening used at step 4 was under converged, go back to step 4, <br />	using a screening file with sufficient nband.<br />	It will probably be smaller than nband used in sigma<br /><br />7) (optional) Make a convergence study on ecutwfn used in the screening.<br />	It will most probably be smaller than ecutwfn used in sigma.<br /><br />8) Make a convergence study on the k-point grid used throughout the GW procedure.<br />	This parameter is quite independent of the rest.<br /><br /><br />Note : If you are not using a plasmon-pole model, you must also do a convergence study on<br />	  the number of frequencies used, which has some interdependence with the <br />	  number of band used in the screening and ecuteps.<br /><br /><br />So the idea here was to start with high parameters in order to converge down the calculation,<br />and avoid having to reiterate the procedure. <br />Are these starting parameter too heavy for common systems? <br />Let me know what you think.</div>
