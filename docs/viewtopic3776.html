				<div class="content">Hello Dear Abiniters,<br />I am a graduate student who started using abinit for various ground state calculations of a ZnO slab. I am a total noob and don't know all the intricacies of the software.I currently need partial charges and as far as i know this can be done by either using Hirshfeld analysis (in cut3d) or Bader Analysis( in the AIM package) both of which just give a qualitative picture. I understand the underlying principle in both and I have found very conflicting results by both methods . I am also having trouble in accurately interpreting the whole data outputted by both these software. I would really appreciate if someone could give some literature that lets me understand all the terms outputted by both methods.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Saurin Rawal<br />Graduate Student,<br />Chemical Engineering Department,<br />Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.</div>

				<div class="content">Hai Saurin<br /><br />I posted my doubt regarding the analysis of the results from Hirshfeld charge analysis on the forum, but till now I didn't get any reply. From your post I understand that you have done both Bader and Hirshfeld analysis using Abinit and got the results. So I thought you could help me with my doubt mentioned below.<br /><br />I am trying to do Hirshfeld charge distribution on graphene supercell. <br /><br />I followed the steps for performing Hirshfeld analysis using cut3d and got results. But I cant understand the terms in the output such as Hirshfeld charge, net charge etc.<br /><br />Which charge I have to take as the charge on the atoms, is it Hirshfeld charge or net charge and what is the difference between these two charges. For calculating charge transfer, I am not sure of which charge I need to take.<br /><br />I would greatly appreciate if you could help me with some comments on the same.<br /><br />Thanks in advance<br />Seba</div>
