				<div class="content">I'm no expert with ABINIT myself, but I believe this is how it works.<br /><br />If you look at the tutorial file: t1x.in, you should see this:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>../t11.in<br />t1x.out<br />t1xi<br />t1xo<br />t1x<br />../../../Psps_for_tests/01h.pspgth</code></pre></div><br /><br />The part that says &quot;../../../Psps_for_tests/01h.pspgth&quot; states the location pseudopotential file (for H atom) on your hard disk.  Of course, the location given is relative to the location of the .files file (hence the &quot;../../../&quot;) and depends on where you saved your pseudopotential file.<br /><br />If you're working with more than 1 type of atom, just start a new line and give the next location. I don't know if the order matters, but I usually list them in the order that I list them in the znucl input variable.  I don't think you can run ABINIT without using pseudopotential files.  I hope that helps.</div>

				<div class="content">hello!!! thanks!!! the problem is that I can't find where are saved the pseudopotentials files,<br />I only find such files for the tests, then I don't know if there are others files and I<br />don't know what does means that (in the abinis help)<br /><br />    * pspcod=1 : Troullier-Martins pseudopotentials, generated by DC Allan and A Khein, <br />                 see ~abinit/doc/psp_infos/     psp1_info.txt ;<br />    * pspcod=2 : Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) pseudopotentials. See Phys. Rev. B 54, 1703 (1996) if needed ;<br />    * pspcod=3 : Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter pseudopotentials. See Phys. Rev. B 58, 3641 (1998) if needed, and the <br />                 file ~abinit/doc/psp_infos/psp3_info.txt ;<br />    * pspcod=4 or 5 : old format pseudopotentials, see ~abinit/doc/psp_infos/psp45_info.txt ;<br />    * pspcod=6 : pseudopotentials from the fhi98pp code, see ~abinit/doc/psp_infos/psp6_info.txt ;<br />    * pspcod=7 : pseudo atomic data for PAW ;<br />    * pspcod=8 : pseudopotential file format from Don Hamann, providing additional flexibility. <br />    <br />thanks</div>

				<div class="content">hi ,<br />in general i can say that ....<br />there isn't any difference between the psp that you download &amp; psp for test in abinit . file both of theme are true and usually don't lead to error if U have an error i think it is related to your input file .<br />if there is your psp among psp for test you can use it but if it is not there you   can make a psp file by vim ....<br /> Sincerely<br />hamideh .</div>
