				<h3>Segmentation fault on Gamma Point</h3>

				<div class="content">Hi all,<br />I am running a calculation about GNR and when I do the screening calculation at Gamma point, abinit always crashes and gives me a segmentation error. For all the other points, they are all good. Does anyone know a reason for that? Thank you so much for the help.<br />BTW: this is a spin-polarized calculation. For unpolarized calculation, everything went well. I am using Abinit 6.6.1 compiled by openmpi.<br />Best regards.<br />xiangpisai</div>

				<div class="content">Dear xiangpisai,<br /><br />Most of the time, a segmentation fault means lack-of-memory. You can test this by monitoring the memory consumption. In a screening calculation, &quot;gwpara  2&quot;, &quot;gwmem  0&quot;, and using PAW can greatly reduce the memory use. The &quot;gw_eet&quot; and &quot;gw_EET_nband&quot; may also help (I have not tested this new technique).<br /><br />If you doubt the problem may come from other issues, just test it by using smaller ecut and nband.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

I have used all what you said except PAW but the problem still exists. What I wonder is, does gamma point consumes a lot more memory than other q-points? Since all the other points run smoothly. I am afraid that there might be something else on this problem but I cannot tell. <br />Anyway, I will test using PAW. Thanks again for your kind help.<br />Best regards!<br />xiangpisai</div>
