				<div class="content">Dear all <br />I would like to perform some calculation on large systems, I was interested in the BigDFT project, but I looked in their webpage and<br />I noticed that from 2006 only 6 articles using BigDFT has been published (all of them by some author of the code), so<br />my question is: Is it really working the code? or the project is dead?<br />someone used it? is it fast, slow?<br /> <br />thanks <br />Sebastiano</div>

				<div class="content">Dear Sebastiano<br /><br />I honestly tried to do calculations with BigDFT but I found it very slow, therefore I come back to plane-waves.<br />Moreover plane-waves allow to perform many kind of calculations not yet implemented in wave-lets,<br />and the output wave-functions can be used from other codes and so on.<br />Anyway my system contained about 100 atoms, so maybe for larger systems BigDFT can be more efficient, I don't know.<br /><br />However notice that also in the articles that used BigDFT  they had more or less this number of atoms, <br />so I doubt that is very efficient for larger systems.<br /><br />Anyway if you really need a fast code for large system I advise you to search for linear scaling codes<br />in localized basis sets, there are many available on the net.<br /><br />with best regards<br />John Cornelius</div>

				<div class="content">Dear John <br /><br />I downloaded and tried BigDFT, and I agree with you, it is slow and not efficient.<br />At the end I will move  to other codes as ONETEP, SIESTA or CYSTAL.<br /><br />thanks<br />Sebastiano</div>
