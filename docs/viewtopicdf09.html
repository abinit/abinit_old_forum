				<div class="content">Dear all  <br /><br />when doing the GW corrctions for few K points followed by their interpolation using the Wannier functions <br />the program stops with printing in the log file: <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>mlwfovlp_qp: WARNING<br />  The input *_WFK file of LDA wavefunctions to be  converted<br />  to GW quasiparticle wavefunctions MUST have been written in<br />  the run that produced the GW *_KSS file using kssform 3,<br />  the ONLY value of kssform permitted for GW Wannier functions.<br />  Otherwise, the *_QPS file needed here will be inconsistent,<br />  and the output quasiparticle wavefunctions will be garbage.<br />  No internal check that can verify this is presently possible.<br /><br /><br /> listkk : BUG -<br />  The minimum square of dk has negative norm: dksqmn=   -1.000000E+00<br />  Action : contact ABINIT group.<br /></div></blockquote><br />It seems that the error here is related on the absence of the XXXi_QPS ( needed on the QP wannier functions) after the standard GW calculations.<br />Is that true ? and gow to get out from this problem ?<br /><br />Kind regards,</div>

				<div class="content">Hi<br /><br />I'm not sure what to suggest because not much details of your calculation is provided. Is it possible to see your input file.<br /><br />Please let me start with this. Basically, in the QP MLWFs calculation, two important ingredients are the *_WFK file and the *_QPS file. Did you have them in place?  As the above warning's suggesting, the *_WFK file must be that used for the generation of  the *_KSS file, with kssform=3. The *_QPS file is that obtained from the screening and self-consistent GW calculations, prior to the MLWFs calculation. You will get the *_QPS file by imposing, for example, &quot;gwcalctyp =28&quot; (for gw using the plasmon-pole model), in the screening and scgw calculations.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Thanusit</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Chem<br /><br />Sorry, I didn't get your point correctly. In performing qpscgw (abinit/test/wannier90/input/t03.in), there is a QPS file resulted from the 1st SCGW iteration. I think this might be the QPS file corresponding to the G0W0. I may be completely wrong about this but It may be worth having a look. Also, hope someone can give us the right answer.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br />Thanusit</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for the late response, <br /><br />In a G0W0 calculation there the QPS file is not produced.<br /><br />There are two possibilites:<br /><br />1) you name the _GW output file as &quot;g0w0&quot;.<br />The code looks for the file &quot;g0w0&quot;, if not found then it looks for the QPS file.<br /><br />2) you can use gwcaltyp 10 to 19, to produce a QPS file.<br />This procedure should be fine, since no extra Sigma matrix elements are being calculated.<br /><br /><br /><br />Best<br />Tonatiun Rangel</div>
