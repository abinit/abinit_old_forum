				<div class="content">Dear all Abinit users:<br /><br />I'm studying the band structure of BC8 Carbon and want to get  the band structure with GW correction.<br /><br />For GW calculation, the kptgw must belong to the k-mesh generated for the KSS file. So, is there a good way to get GW correction for common k-points so that we can construct a band structure along the high symmetry lines?<br /><br />Many thanks for your comments and advices.<br /><br />Yu</div>

				<div class="content">Due to the non-locality of the exact-exchange and of the self-energy operator, there is no possibility to avoid the use of a regular grid within GW.<br />My advice to obtain the GW band structure is to perform the GW corrections for all the the k-points in the full Brillouin Zone and then perform a Fourier interpolation to obtain the GW band structure along a given line.<br />This is not so straightforward. We should definitely provide a tool to do that operation...<br /><br />Fabien</div>

				<div class="content">At present one can use wannier90 to perform the Wannier interpolation of the <br />GW band structure produced by abinit. See test/wannier90/t03.in and <br />the test/wannier90/README. <br /><br />I agree however that we should provide an automatic and painless way <br />for interpolating QP band structures.   <br /><br />Matteo</div>

				<div class="content">Dear all, <br /><br />Can do it in the following way?:<br />1) First perform a self consistent LDA/GGA calculation using a conventional file with a regular k-grid.<br />2) Copy the  values for keywords related to the generated k-point such as  nkpt, kpt, and wtk, and explicitly add all desired k-points along high-symmetry lines of the BZ that are needed for the band structure plot. Add the them into the input file, but set the weights of these added k-points (i.e., the k-points for band structure plots) to 0. Correspondingly, set the number of k-points (i.e., the value of nkpt) in input file correctly (to the number of the k-points used in the standard mesh PLUS the number of the k-points along the lines), such that all k-points are used for the calculations.<br />3) Perform a second LDA/GGA calculation;<br />4) Perform a GW calculation with k points in the step 2);<br />5) The GW-eigenvalues of the states along the high-symmetry lines are written in output;  cut the k-points required for the band structure from one of output file and proceed as usual.<br /><br />I observed that such way is adopted in the VASP code for the hybrid functional calculation of band structure. I wondered whether this way is feasible to do the GW calculation of band structure with ABINIT code.  Welcome to your comments. <br /><br />Best regards<br />Hou</div>

				<div class="content">No, the k-points need to be regularly spaced in a GW calculation. The same is also true for the exact-exchange. So I don't know what VASP is doing for hybrid.<br /><br />Fabien</div>

				<div class="content">It sounds like it is integrating E, n, etc... only on the first kpt (with weights) but calculate all the eigenvalues so you get the BS at the same time.<br /><br />I'm not sure this would work in abinit - there are a few places where the weights might not be used explicitly, and then you would get spurious kpt contributions. Interesting test though! Try it for a ground state run and tell us if it works.<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
