				<div class="content">Dear abiniters,<br />I do some GW calculations with abinit, I was using the version 6.0.4, but since I wanted to exploit the new features of abinit to save time (e.g. symsigma) I migrate to version 6.4.2.<br />Everything is fine with both version as long as I use gwcalctyp&lt;10 but then I tried gwcalctyp=10 with the version 6.4.2 and I encounter an error message:<br /><br />  (k,b,s) stated owned by rank:            0<br />  ug stored at (spin, ik_ibz)            1           1<br />           8           9          10          16          32          48<br />          64          80          96         112         128         144<br />         160         176         192<br />....<br />....[here is a line for each k point]<br />....<br />  ug stored at (spin, ik_ibz)            1          85<br />           7           8           9          10          16          32<br />          48          64          80          96         112         128<br />         144         160         176         192<br /> Subroutine Unknown:0:ERROR<br /> Nobody has (band1, ik_ibz) (band2, ikp_ibz) spin: 7 2 8 2 1<br /><br />I assume that this has something to do with the bands distributed on processors (I had a quick look at the 66_wfs/m_wfs.F90 subroutine), It seems that all the bands are not here but I don't understand why? <br />I did the same calculation with the version 6.0.4 and abinit doesn't complain, but this test was not present at that time in the 66_wfs/m_wfs.F90 subroutine. I have seen in the release notes that the new variables like gw_sctype are now available, but I am not sure that this will influence (fix the problem for) my calculation.<br /><br />Here is a copy of my input file:<br /><br />ndtset     6<br />gwpara      2        # parallelization over bands instead of k-point<br />gwcalctyp  10      # 22: scGW + contour integral, 10: self-consistency on energies only and PP model, 0: no self-consistency and PP model<br />ppmodel     1      # 1 (default): ppmodel from Godby and Needs, 0: numerical integration (contour integral) from Lebegue et al.<br />#gwcomp      1      # (0: default). 1: to improve the completeness in a truncated sum over states<br />#gwencomp    3.0     # default: 2 Ha, maybe not the optimum but should be ok according to the paper Bruneval PRB 2008<br /><br /># Calculation of the screening (epsilon^-1 matrix)<br />#optdriver1  3        # Screening calculation<br />#getkss1     1        # Obtain KSS file from previous dataset<br />##getqps1    -1<br />            #nband1      17       # Bands to be used in the screening calculation<br />#nband1      300       # Bands to be used in the screening calculation<br />#npwwfn1     965      # should correspond to 16.68 Ha<br />#npweps1     283      # 6.95 Ha<br />                     #ppmfrq1    16.7 eV   # Imaginary frequency where to calculate the screening<br />                     #awtr1       0        # Note : the default awtr 1 is better<br /><br /># Calculation of the Self-Energy matrix elements (GW corrections)<br />optdriver  4        # Self-Energy calculation<br />#symsigma   1        # Take into account the symmetry of the k points in sigma<br />getkss     1        # Obtain KSS file from dataset 1<br />getscr     1        # Obtain SCR file from previous dataset<br />getqps?    -1        # Get eigenvalues from previous step<br />nband      200      # Bands to be used in the Self-Energy calculation<br />npwwfn    2445     # Planewaves to be used to represent the wavefunctions (16.68 Ha)<br />npwsigx   1989      # Dimension of the G sum in Sigma_x<br />                     # (the dimension in Sigma_c is controlled by npweps)<br /><br />nkptgw      85               # number of k-point where to calculate the GW correction<br />kptgw                        # k-points<br />                    -6.25000000E-02 -6.25000000E-02  0.00000000E+00<br />                    -6.25000000E-02 -1.87500000E-01  0.00000000E+00<br />                    -1.25000000E-01 -1.25000000E-01  0.00000000E+00<br />                    -6.25000000E-02 -1.25000000E-01  6.25000000E-02<br />                    ....<br /><br />bdgw    9  10            # calculate GW corrections for bands from 4 to 5<br />            9  10<br />            9  10<br />            9  10<br />            9  10<br />           ....<br /><br /># Data common to the three different datasets<br /><br /># Definition of the unit cell: fcc<br />acell  3*10.658             # Default unit is bohr<br />rprim  0.0  0.5  0.5        # FCC primitive vectors (to be scaled by acell)<br />       0.5  0.0  0.5<br />       0.5  0.5  0.0<br /><br /># Definition of the atom types<br />ntypat  2         # There is only one type of atom<br />znucl 31 33       # The keyword &quot;znucl&quot; refers to the atomic number of the<br />                  # possible type(s) of atom.
