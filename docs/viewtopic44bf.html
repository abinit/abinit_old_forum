				<div class="content">Dear ALL:<br /><br />      When trying to do the response function calculation, I follow a similar scheme as tutorial &quot;toptic1.in &quot; to calculate DDK.<br />      while properly converged K-mesh and energy cutoff are applied, log file tells me :<br /><br />-P-0000  memana : ERROR -<br />-P-0000   Test failed to allocate    6243.982 Mbytes<br />-P-0000   It is not worth to continue<br />-P-0000   Action : modify input variable to fit the available memory.<br />-P-0000   or increase limit on available memory.<br /><br />      Thus I try to run the 6 datasets separately, and found that only dataset3, where full Brillouin Zone non-SCF calculation step causes this problem. <br /><br />    I purchased 16G memory for my own desktop computer, and there is no such problem. But I cannot run it forever in a personal computer. <br /><br />    When I turn back to the Cluster, it always has such information. (Thus I will try promote my level in the cluster, definitely)<br /><br />    Any possible solution to solve this Memory Allocation problem?  Is there anyway to overcome this problem? <br /><br />Thanks a lot!!<br /><br /><br />ps: when &quot;ecut&quot; is modified, say from 100 Ha to 10 Ha, a PC can run it in few minutes without any problem. <br />However, when ecut is increased, even a cluster cannot help to run it, and always show &quot; Test failed to allocate &quot; message.<br /><br /><br />Solution: <br /><br />   It appears to be a memory limit problem, however even when I get 32Gb memory, it still tells me that it fails to allocate 5Gb. This value is memory per core, so total is 5*Number of cores. However, it is actually not a memory problem, it is caused that it is compiled as 32bit program. When compiling Abinit, enable &quot; --with-64bit-flag&quot;, will solve this problem.</div>
