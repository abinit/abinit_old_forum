				<div class="content">Hello, <br />i have a question regarding the implememtation of vdW density functional. I was wondering which <span class="posthilit">van</span> <span class="posthilit">der</span> <span class="posthilit">Waals</span> exchange-correlation functional one can use at this moment in ABINIT, in order to have the 'vdw_xc' input variable working properly. <br />Thanks for your attention,<br />Valentina</div>

				<div class="content">Hi, <br />during this time i've tried to solve this problem by generating and then using APE's pseudopotentials. If i use the 'usual' LDA (PW) pseudopotential, i will get the right acell, and the same happens for GGA (PBE). When i use the GGA composed by PBE for correlation and revPBE for exchange, then ixc= -102130, the cell parameter is just a bit over-estimated. Then, once i try the psp needed for the vdw_xc variable :<br />vdw_xc 1    ixc -102012  and psp= LDA_PW_correlation + revPBE_exchange<br />vdw_xc 2    ixc -108012        psp=   LDA_PW_correlation + PW86_exchange<br />I do not get the right acell (i started from checking the acell as a check for the reliability of the psp), but it is in both cases really under-estimated. This scenario doesn't change if i don't use the vdW variable. I tried to set ixc = -108012 with psp= 'usual' LDA (PW) without setting vdw_xc, and what i've got is the same bad result. Then i tried with ixc -102 with psp= 'usual' LDA (PW) without setting vdw_xc and in this case the calculation went wrong, (The new primitive vectors rprimd (an evolving quantity) are too large with respect to the old rprimd and the accompanying dilatmx :this large change of unit cell parameters is not allowed by the present value of dilatmx.). My last attempt was to set ixc -102 and using as psp  LDA_PW_correlation + revPBE_exchange, but again, i've got the previous error. I was using ixc -102 because it was the value that was given as an example in the share/abinit/vdwxc directory of abinit. So, now, i am wondering about what to do/try next, because, in my opinion, it is the libxc that seems having problems, and not the psp, but i might be wrong.<br />I am looking forward to hear an answer,<br />best regards,<br />Valentina</div>
