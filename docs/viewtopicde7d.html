				<div class="content">Dear all,<br>
<br>
I am doing a supercell calculation of MoS2 bulk and I have made a 2 x 2 x 1 supercell by translating. (input file attached)<br>
As I am using a supercell my bandstructure has to be unfolded back into 1st BZ using fold2Bloch. I do as said in the tutorial of hydrogen atom on the abinit webpage. I am using abipy to plot the unfolded bandstructure. <br>
Here are my errors and questions: <br>
a) I include SOC in my ground state calculations and hence when i use abipy to unfold the bands after fold2Bloch I get the following error<br>
<br>
IndexError: index 1 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 1 abipy<br>
<br>
which points to the following line <br>
<br>
ys = self.uf_eigens[spin, p.ikfound, :] - e0 <br>
<br>
of the code. So my question, can I do unfolding of the bands when SOC is included in ground state calculations?<br>
<br>
b) I switch off the SOC and do the calculation again, then I can see a bandstructure appearing from abipy. In this regard also I am facing a problem in deciding the k-path. I read that if I want GK path then I need to include -KG path as well in the calculations. I did as suggested in the tutorial but I do not get the full path from GK even after including the -KG path.<br>
I want the bandstructure along GKMG path of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. For doing so I use the following kbounds<br>
<br>
kptbounds2  -2/3  -1/3   0.0  # -K point<br>
                         0.0   0.0   0.0  # Gamma point<br>
                        2/3   1/3   0.0  # K point<br>
                        1/2   0.0   0.0  # M point<br>
                        0.0   0.0   0.0  # Gamma point<br>
                       -1/2   0.0   0.0  # -M point <br>
<br>
I am attaching the bandstructure as obtained from the above path.<br>
Apart from this kbounds I also tried various other combinations like -MKM to get the KM path but no success till now. Any help will be appreciated.<br>
<br>

				<div class="content">Hello developers,<br>
<br>
With some hit and try I was able to get the Brillouin zone path sorted out but I can unfold the bands when spin-orbit coupling is turned on. Is that feature not implemented in abipy?<br>
<br>
Also my conduction bands are not clearly visible. Any idea how do I improve those? File attached of 2:2:1 supercell.</div>

Dear nsingh3,<br>
 I have a problem in deciding the k-path of MoS2 using fold2Bloch. Can you send me the successful cases of MoS2? Thank you very much.  My Email is <a href="mailto:gswylq@gmail.com">gswylq@gmail.com</a>.</div>
