				<div class="content">Good day<br /><br />I am trying to compile last version of abinit (6.12.3) with last version of openmpi (1.6.2) compiled with intel compilers (version 13.0.0). Everything works fine until<br />the compilation of the Atompaw package, just in the final step of its compilation I get:<br /><br /><div class="codebox"><p>Code: <a href="#" onclick="selectCode(this); return false;">Select all</a></p><pre><code>libtool: link: mpif90 -free -g -extend-source -vec-report0 -noaltparam -nofpscomp -O3 -xHOST -g -I/opt/abinit-6.12.3/fallbacks/exports/include -o atompaw atompaw_prog.o --start-group --end-group&nbsp; ./.libs/libatompaw.a -L/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/ -L/opt/abinit-6.12.3/fallbacks/exports/lib -L/home/arcesio/Downloads/openmpi-1.6.2/opal/mca/hwloc/hwloc132/hwloc/src /usr/local/lib/libxc.a -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread /opt/abinit-6.12.3/fallbacks/exports/lib/libnetcdf.a /usr/local/lib/libmpi_f90.so /usr/local/lib/libmpi_f77.so /usr/local/lib/libmpi.so -lm -ldl -lrt -lnsl -lutil -pthread -rpath /usr/local/lib -rpath /usr/local/lib<br />ifort: command line warning #10006: ignoring unknown option '-fstart-group'<br />ifort: command line warning #10006: ignoring unknown option '-fend-group'<br />ifort: command line remark #10010: option '-pthread' is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

				<div class="content">Hi Arcesio,<br /><br />You're right, the problem here is that the linker rpath directive is badly formed, ignored and the remaining /usr/local/lib directory is read as a library filename which the interprocess optimizer doesn't appreciate at all. Sorry but abinit 6 hasn't been tested with intel 13 compiler (?) - and I would probably not recommend to use anything from Intel that carries &quot;.0.0&quot; in its name <img class="smilies" src="images/smilies/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /> There are different treatments for the numerous versions of Intel compilers in the build system, I'll have a look on how to adapt it for Intel 13 for the future version of Abinit (and it has to be tested); atompaw configuration also has to be modified - there is something fishy with libtool here. I love the <blockquote class="uncited"><div>We (the Libtool maintainers) assert that always using `-rpath' is a good thing</div></blockquote> paragraph in libtool documentation.<br /><br />The easiest solution for you here is probably to disable atompaw by configuring Abinit option with_dft_flavor=&quot;bigdft+libxc+wannier90&quot;. If you need this pseudo generator, you'll find the source tar.gz in your ~/.abinit/tarballs/ directory (or on its website) and ample info on how to compile it standalone - there is no benefit from using mpi compilers, atompaw is a sequential program - compile it with a decent version of gfortran, lapack, blas (or MKL for the extra performance but atompaw only runs for a few seconds) and libxc (there is a libxc.a conveniently available in you fallbacks/exports/lib/ directory)<br /><br />Another &quot;dirty&quot; hack here would be to move to the fallbacks/sources/atompaw-3.0.1.3/src and perform the final link step that failed by pasting the line you mentioned i.e. mpif90 -free up to -pthread, removing the offending -rpath and the rest of the line. But it's only a partial reliever; if you restart the make process after that, it will try to rebuild atompaw again and fall on the same problem.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Alain</div>
