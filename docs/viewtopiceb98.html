				<div class="content">Dear developers,<br /><br />I find that the berry phase calculation, the 3rd perturbation in spin-polarized Raman calculation, and the sigma calculation in SCF-GW have some parallel limitations, which are not mentioned in official documents.<br /><br />(1) For the problem in berry phase calculation, one can test the tffield_6.in. If one runs it with CPU cores over 7, the calculation will never finish, and the CPU and memory are always well occupied.<br /><br />(2) For the 3rd perturbation in the spin-polarized Raman calculation, one can use only one core to calculate it, or abinit will stop will the following information. (I have attached a test file)<br />          -P-0000  leave_test : synchronization done...<br />          kpgio: loop on k-points done in parallel<br />          -P-0000<br />          -P-0000  leave_new : decision taken to exit ...<br /><br />(3) In the sigma calculation of SCF-GW, certain restriction on the number of CPU core also exists. For the test file I attached, one can use 6 cores at most, or abinit will fail with the following printout. <br />          m_wfs.F90:3674:ERROR<br />          Nobody has (band1, ik_ibz) (band2, ikp_ibz) spin: 29 1 44 1 1<br />          -P-0000<br />          -P-0000  leave_new : decision taken to exit ...<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Guangfu Luo</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Guangfu -thanks for your checking.<br /><br />You are quite correct - there should be more intrinsic checks and more explicit error messages. For the hangs you saw this is fixed in recent versions: you are told that certain processors are not answering, and this is usually because they have no k-points at all.<br /><br />This is possible if you give too many procs or if your distributions of kpt per proc is, e.g., 2 2 2 1 0 for 7 kpts on 5 procs: mkmem = 2 and you can see that you could do the same calculation in the same time on 4 procs. The 0-kpt processor hangs basically.<br /><br />To make sure you are seeing real bugs you should eliminate these cases of parallelization beyond the number of k-points available.<br /><br />For the other cases we'll have to look more closely.<br /><br />Matthieu</div>
